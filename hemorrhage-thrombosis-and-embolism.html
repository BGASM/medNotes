Is it blood, or is it a thrombi?<br>```<br>The pathophysiology of hemostatic mechanisms can be determined by looking for sources of abnormalities. - *Virchow's Triad*.<br>- Endothelial Injury/Dysfunction<br>- Injury here leads to exposure of ECM, released tissue factor,adherence of plateleys and begins the coagulation cascade.<br>1. Myocardial infarction<br>2. Atherosclerotic plaques<br>3. Trauma<br>- Dysfunction is any state where normal procoagulant and anticoagulant properties get messed up.<br>1. Production of more procoagulant factor (plateley adhesion molecule, tissue factor, plasminogen activator inhibitor)<br>2. LESS production of anti-coagulant factors (thrombomodulin, PGI2, tPA)<br>- Hypercoagulability *thromophilia*<br>- This can be the major etiology for any patient in a clinical setting, loosely defined as any alteration of the coagulation pathway that predisposes one to thrombosis.<br>- Causes can be genetic (*primary*) or acquired (*secondary*) in nature.<br>- **Primary:**<br>- Factor V Leiden - Factor V<br>- Prothrombin gene mutation<br>- Hyperhomocysteinemia<br>- **Secondary:**<br>- Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia syndrome<br>- Antiphospholipid antibody syndrom<br>- Abnormal blood flow<br>- Disruption of laminar flow allows for coagulation components to start sticking.<br>- This can be caused by hyperviscosity, sickle cell anemia, or aneurysms.<br>## Morphology of thrombus<br>Desribe a thrumbus.<br>- Arterial Thrombi<br>- Venous Thrombi<br>- DVT<br>- Mural Thrombi<br>- Vegetations<br>- Post-mortem<br>## Fate of the thrombus<br>- If the initial insult is not fatal, one of four pathways can be discerned.<br>1. Propagation – accentuation and prolongation of the hemostatic process<br>2. Embolization – thrombi that disassociate from their main mass and travel to other sites in the vascular tree.<br>3. Dissolution – Small and/or recent thrombi can undergo fibrinolysis and completely resolve.<br>- Larger and/or older thrombi are more resistant to lysis.<br>4. Organization – the process of incorporating a thrombus into the “new normal.”<br>- Variable ingrowth of endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts to create remodeled vascular channels (**recanalization**), albeit imperfectly.<br><br>## Embolism<br>An embolism is a **detached intravascular solid, liquid, or gaseous mass** that gets carried by blood to some other site. A *thromboembolism* is an emolism that originates from a dislodged thrombus. Emboli can lodge in a vessels that are too small to permit passage, and this can cause vascular occlusion, which can lead to ischemic necrosis/infarction.<br>- Pulmonary Embolus **PE**<br>- Venous in nature<br>- Commonly from DVT.<br>- Travel through large veins, through the right side of the heart and then get trapped in pulmonary arterial vasculatire.<br>- Single embolus can straddle pulmonary artery bifurcation (saddle embolus)<br>- Can lodge in a pulmonary artery main branch and cause one-sided disease<br>- Most frequently, one or both sides of the lungs get small emboli that lodge in the smallest arterioles possible<br>- **Patients who have had one PE are at high risk for having another**<br>- `&gt;60% ovvlusion can cause cardiovascular collapse.<br>- Can lead to pulmonary hemorrhage, but not usually infarction<br>- Small end-arterioles pulm. branches don't usually hemorrhage or infarct.<br>- Multiple small emboli (over time) can cause pulmonary hypertension and right sided heart failure<br>- Systemic (thrombo-)embolus *Cause infarction typically*<br>- Usually defined as an embolus in arterial circulation.<br>- 80% from **intracardiac mural thrombi**. Other causes include:<br>- Valvular vegetation<br>- Paradoxical embolus (venous embolism that makes it to arterial circulation because of other cardiac defect)<br>- Aortic aneurysm<br>- Thrombus on ulcerated atherosclerotic plaque.<br>- Emboli in arteries most likely lodge in the lower extremities (75%) and brain (10%), with theintestines, kidneys, spleen and upper extremities also affected.<br>- Fat and Marrow Embolism<br>- After injury there can be a rupture of soft tissue venules or marrow vascular sinusoids.<br>- Adipose tissue or bone marrow can herniate into the intravascular space and travel to lungs and get lodged.<br>- Fracture of long bones: 90% of severe skeletal injuries lead to embolism, but only 10% have symptoms.<br>- Soft tissue Trauma<br>- Burns<br>- **Vigorous cardiopulmonary resuscitation**:<br>- **Fat Embolism Syndrome** is a situation where these types of embolism ARE symptomatic.<br>- After 1-3 days patient experience pulmonary insufficiency, neuro symptoms, anemia, thrombocytopenia and a diffuse petechial rash.<br>- This can be fatal in 5-15% of paitents.<br>- Air embolism:<br>- More than 100cc of air is enough to have a clinical effect on pulmonary circulation.<br>- Volumes smaller than that can be catastrophic if introduced into coronary circulation.<br>- ie. during a coronary bypass surgery.<br>- Decompression Sickness<br>- Bends - gas bubbles in skeletal muscles<br>- Chokes - respiratory distress caused by pulmonary gas emboli. Leads to edema, hemorrhage, and emphysema:<br>- Caisson disease - chronic decompression condition. Persistence of gas emboli in skeletal system leads to multpile foci of ischemic necrosis<br>- Mainly seen in femoral head, tibia, and humeri.<br>- Amniotic Fluid Embolism:<br>- Squamous cells, fat, or mucin make it to pulmonary vasculature<br>- Severe respiratory compromise (dyspnea and cyanosis)<br>- followed by Neuro impairment (headache, seizure, coma)<br>- Finally disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).<br>```<br>Incidence is 1 in 40,000 deliveries<br>Mortality is 80%, making it the fifth most common cause of maternal mortality<br>worldwide<br>Causes 10% of the maternal deaths in the US<br>85% of patients that survive have neurologic deficits<br>```</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on November 30, 2020</p></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://BGASM.github.io/medNotes/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://BGASM.github.io/medNotes/edema-congestion-and-hemostasis.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Edema Congestion and Hemostasis</a></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://BGASM.github.io/medNotes/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
