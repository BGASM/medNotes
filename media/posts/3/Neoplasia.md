Neoplasm
- An abormal mass whose growth rate exceeds that of the normal surrounding tissue
- Persists after stimuli that caused it is removed.
Cancer:
 - A disorder of cell growth caused by a series of acquired mutations.
 - Affects a single cell and its clonal progen.
 - The mutations that caused this give the neoplastic cells a survival and growth advantage.
   - Autonomous
Nomenclature:
 - Tumors are comosed of two major components:
   - Parenchyma
     - clonal neoplastic cells
     - epithelial or mesenchymal origin
   - Supportive Stroma
     - Connective tissue: collagen, protein, etc.
     - Blood vessels
Rules:
 - Cancer from a Mesenchymal origin:
   - Benign: "-oma"
     - *fibrma, osteoma, etc*
   - Malignant: "-sarcoma"
     - *fibrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, etc* 
 - Cancer from a Epithelial origin:
   - Benign: "-oma"
     - Cell of origin: *adrenal adenoma*
     - Microscopic architecture: *adenoma, papilloma*
   - Malignant: "-carcinoma"
     - Cell of origin: *squamous cell carcinoma*
     - Microscopic architecture: *adenocarcinoma*
Misnomers:
 - Lymphoma: malignancy of lymphoid tissues
   - Sounds like it would be benign because of suffic -oma, but it is malignant.
   - *malignant lymphoma* is redudant. Lymphoma *is* malignant.
- Leukemia:malignant hematopoietic stem cells
- Glioma: malignant CNS
- Melanoma: malignant melanocyte
- Hepatoma: haptocellular carcinoma
- Seminoma: 
Other:
 - *Mixed tumor*, pleomorphic adenoma (salivary gland)
   - cells of divergent differentiation but representing a single germ layer 
 - Teratoma
   - mass of cells of different germ layer origin
 - Hamartoma
   - Abberant/disorganized **benign** mass containing mature cells or tissue indigenous to the organ
 - Choristoma:
   - heterotopic mass of cells in an unrelated organ

Differentiation of Tumors
 - Differentiation refers to the extent that neoplastic cells resemble comparable cells
   - Based on function or Morphology
 - Benign tumors are **well-differentiated**.
   - They resemble mature cells in morphology or their function
 - Malignant tumors can vary
   - Malignant neoplasms can be well-differentiated
   - Or, they can be completely undifferentiated - *anaplastic*
 -SUMMARY: There cannot be poorly-differentiated benign tumors. There **can** be poorly- or well-differentiated malignant neoplasms
Morphologic Marks of Anaplasia
```
Anaplasia is the loss of the mature or specialized features/functions of a cell tissue.
```
 - Loss of polarity
 - Extensive necrosis
 - Abnormal nuclear Morphology
 - Pleomorphism
 Metaplasia
  - Refers to the replacement of one type of cells with another.
    - *Example is intestinal metaplasia of squamous epithelium of the esophagus in response to chronic acid reflux*
Dysplasia
 - Disordered growth
 - Found in epithelia. Especially metaplastic (*replacement of cell with another type*).
 - Consetllation of changes:
   - loss in uniformity
   - loss of architectural orientation
   - pleomorphism
   - hyperchromatic, large nucleicmitotic figures
     - more aboundant
     - non-invasiveness  
Carcinoma *in situ*
- Pre-invasive lesion
- Dysplastic changeds are marked
- Involve entire thickness of epithelium
- Remains confined to normal tissue
Local Invasion
 - Benign tumors expand locally. It looks like they form a *capsule* of compressed connective tissue around the tumor. 
 - Bening tumors do not directly incade or infiltrate surrounding tissue.
 - Malignant tumors are not clearly demarcated (no capsule of compressed tissue)
 - Malignant do invade
Metastases
 - Hallmakr of malignant tumors
 - Patterns:
   - Direct seeding of surface or body cavity: *peritoneum, pleura*
   - Lymphatic: *Lymph node spread*
   - Hematogenous: *Liver, lung*
 Cancer Epidemiology
  - Long and bronchus are the most lethal of all.
  - Second most lethal cancer in men and women is *colorectum*
  - Prostate leading cancer in males
  - Breast leading cancer in females
Risk Factors
 - Environmental factors have a dominant effect.
 - Age: don't get old.
   - fem:40-79
   - men:60-79 *if we didn't die because of a bad heart, we'll die to cancer*
   - Incidence and Mortality both increase with age. 
 - Ethnicity: AA higher incidence of prostate in male. CA have higher incidence of breast
 - Genetic predisposition:
   - Only 8-10% of cancers are linked to inherited genetic predis.
   - Autosomal Dom:
     - Signle allele mutation presdisposes to cancer
   - Defective DNA repair:
     - AutoRec: XP, AT, Bloom
     - AutoDom: HNPCC
   - Familial Cancers:
     - No clear pattern of transmission. Breast (other than BRCA1/2) colon (other than HNPCC, APC)
 - Acquired predisposing factors
   - Inflammation
     - Genomic injury by ROS production
     - increase sissue stem cell pool in response to the need of damage repair
   - Precursor lesions
     - Barret esophagus, solar keratosis, ulcerative colitis, leukoplakia, endometrial hyperplasia
   - Immunodeficiency
     - Increased risk of oncogenic virus related cancers (*lymphoma, carcinoma, sarcoma*)
       - Seen a lot in HIV or patients that have gotten a transplant and are on immuno-suppressants.
