<h1 id="edema">Edema</h1>
<hr />
<p>60% bodyweight is water, 2/3 which is intracellular.
   - Of the remaining water, 35% is in extracellular space. AKA interstitial fluid and &lsquo;third spaces&rsquo;
        - Third space is not quite interstitial, its like the cavities of the pleual or abdominal cavities, the pericardial sac. And fluid does collect in these spaces.
 - There is a balance of vascular hydrostatic pressure against plasma colloid osmotic pressure.
    - Hydrostatic is always a little higher, because fluid needs to escape the vessel and reach lymphatics.
    - While RBCs die, we will also keep fluid moving overall.  </p>
<p>Transudate
  - Protein and cell poor edema that is caused by an increase in hydrostatic pressure, or a reduction in plasma proteins.<br />
  - It is common in organ failure and malnutrition.<br />
  - Appears clear or amber.  </p>
<p>Exudate
  - Protein and cell rich edema that is caused by inflammation.<br />
  - It is one of the outcomes caused by the cascade of inflammatory-induced events (vascular permeability, cellular response.)<br />
  - Fluid appears amber or cloudy.</p>
<h2 id="edema-names">Edema Names:</h2>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>Anasarca: Whole-body generalized and severe edema with subcutaneous tissue swelling.  </li>
<li>Serous: A transudate or light exudate with mainly edema fluid.  </li>
<li>Serosanguinous: Effusion with RBC.  </li>
<li>Fibrinous: Fibrin strans that bridge from heart and pericardial sac and are derived from a protein rich exudate.  </li>
<li>Purulent: Exudate with numerous neutrophils. ALso called empyema in pleural space.  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="severity">Severity:</h2>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>Edema can range from having minimal to life threatening consequences.</li>
<li>Subcutaneous can be a bite or a blister, or it can signal systemic cardiac or renal disease.</li>
<li>Localized edema can inhibit wound healing, prevent clearing pathogens, or cause a physical obstruction.</li>
<li>Pulmonary edema can be caused by several clinical scenarious, and it can be life threatening.</li>
<li>Cerebral edema can also be fatal, as it developes rapidly and can cause the brain to herniate.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="morphology">Morphology:</h2>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>Pitting Edema:</li>
<li>Subcutaneous:<ul>
<li>Appears swollen, shiny and boggy</li>
<li>Compression artifact that resolves slowly.</li>
<li>Gravity and hydrostatic pressure cause <strong>dependent edema</strong> in the legs when standing or sacrum with prone.</li>
<li>Linked with Right heart failure</li>
<li>Poor blood return. Blood backs up into vena cava and edema builds up in lowed extremities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pulmonary:<ul>
<li>Heavy wet lungs.</li>
<li>Frothy, blood-tinged fluid expressed when compressing parenchyma.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cerebral:<ul>
<li>Generalized or local swelling.</li>
<li>Expanded gyri, narrowed sulci</li>
<li>Herniation of brain or brainstem</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pathophysiology-of-non-inflammatory-edema">Pathophysiology of Non-Inflammatory Edema:</h2>
<hr />
<pre><code>    + Remeber that inflammatory edema makes sense. 
    + Inflammation leads to vascular permeability/dilation.
    + This hyperemia allows fluid to leave vessels and settle, causing edema.
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>Increased hydrostatic pressure <strong>Usually Cardiac</strong><ul>
<li>Can occur due as regional or systemic.</li>
<li>Localized edema in one leg can lead to <strong>DVT</strong> which can cause a focal impairment of venous return.</li>
<li>Generalized <strong>increases in venous pressure can also lead to systemic edema</strong>. Such as in congestive heart failure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reduced oncotic pressure due to inadequate plasma protein (albumin) <strong>Usually Hepatic</strong><ul>
<li>Reduced albumin synthesis (<strong>liver disease</strong>), malnut</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary sodium retention. <strong>Kidneys</strong></li>
<li>Primary water retention</li>
<li>Lymphatic obstruction leading to lymphedema.<ul>
<li>Usually localized.</li>
<li>Lymphedema in an extremity, usually upper arm, is seen commonly due to removal of or radiation to axiallary lymph nodes. <strong>Breast Cancer</strong></li>
<li>Parasitic disease <strong>filariasis</strong> show extensive lower limb and genital edema.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="congestion-and-hyperemia">Congestion and Hyperemia:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Occur when a vascular space is expanded.</li>
<li>Both result from <strong>locally increased blood volume</strong>.</li>
<li>Associated with increased intravascular pressures, which often lead to edema.</li>
<li><strong>Hyperemia</strong> is an active process. It is due to blood inflow from arterial dilation.</li>
<li>Tissue becomes red and engorged with blood. <strong>Obvious when seen</strong></li>
<li>Seen in skeletal muscle when exercising, or sites of inflammation.</li>
<li><strong>Congestion</strong> is a passive proocess due to impaired outflow of blood from tissue.</li>
<li>Tissue are blue <strong>cyanotic</strong>  due to accumulation of deoxyhemoglobin.</li>
<li>Over time, lack of oxygenated blood lead to localized hypoxia - which can eventually lead to ischemia and necrosis.</li>
<li>Capillaries rupture. Lead to characterisitc <strong>hemosiderin-laden macrophages</strong></li>
<li>Organ Specific Congestion has characteristic morphologic changes:<ul>
<li>Chronic pulmonary congestion:</li>
<li>Alveolara septa get thick and fibrotic.</li>
<li>Lots of the hemosiderin-laden macrophages (<strong>heart failure cells</strong>)</li>
<li>Chronic hepatic congestion:</li>
<li>Homorrhage within the lobes of the liver lead to a dumping-out of the hemosiderin-laden macrophages and hepatocytes.</li>
<li>These cells undergo ischemia and necrosis and they make the liver look mottled, red-brown, and depressed.<ul>
<li><strong>Nutmeg Liver</strong></li>

</ul>
<h1 id="hemostasis">Hemostasis</h1>
<ul>
<li>Sequence of Events:
  1. Following injury <strong>vasoconstriction</strong> limits blood flow in the area. Vasoconstriction is transient and augmented by endothelial cell endothelin.
  2. Exposed <strong>extracellular matrix is thrombogenic</strong>. Induces reaction that causes <strong>adherence and activateion of platelets</strong> in order to form a <strong>hemostatic plug</strong>.
  3. Endothelial cells release tissue factor (<strong>factor III or thromboplastin</strong>) which works iwht factor VII to initiate <strong>coagulation</strong>. Thrombin gets generated at the site and cleaves <strong>fibrinogen into fibrin</strong>. Forms a fibrin mesh and this is secondary hemostasis.
  4. Fibrin and platelet aggregates form a stable plug. Counter processes to stop and revers thrombus formation.  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bleeding-or-hypercoagulable-state">Bleeding or Hypercoagulable state:</h3>
<hr />
<pre><code>- **Bleeding State**
- Bernard-Soulier Syndrome GP1B.
- Von Willibrand disease due to too little or too weak vWF.
- Glanzmaan thromoasthenia due to deficiency in GpIIa-IIIb.
</code></pre>
<h3 id="platlet-vs-coagulation-cascade-qualitative-vs-quantitative">Platlet vs Coagulation Cascade: Qualitative vs Quantitative**</h3>
<hr />
<pre><code>- Platelet Tests:
  - Qualitative: Bleed time
  - Quantitative: Platelets are measured and counted.
- Coagulation Tests:
  - Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time - aPPT
  - Prothrombin Time - PT.

<ul>
<li>Normal endothelium supports a state of anti-coagulation. If there is an injury we flip things up.<ul>
<li>von WIllibrong Factor (GP1B receptor - deficiency is called Bernard-Soulier syndrome)</li>
<li>Tissue factor: Ectivates extrinsic pathway in response to TNF.</li>
