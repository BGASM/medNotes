<h2 id="mao-inhibitors-phenelzine-and-selegiline">MAO Inhibitors - Phenelzine and Selegiline</h2>
<hr />
<pre><code>- When catecholamines and 5HT are taken up, they are inactivated by MAO or COMPT. (Tissue more COMPT, Nerve ending more MAO)
- This takes place before storage of NT. They get inactivated before storage.
&gt; MAO-A and MAO-B. Both cause irreversible inhibition of MAO.
    - MAO-A is not selective
    - MAO-B is selevtive for dopamine.
    - Phenelzine inhibits MAO-A and MAO-B
        - Increase in NE, DA, 5HT
    - Selegiline inhibits MAO-B
        - Increase in DA.
    &gt; Therapeutic Use:
        - Depression: Phenelzine
        - Parkinson: Selegiline (disease with low levels of Dopa.)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="comt-inhibitors-entacapone-levodopa-cabidopa">COMT Inhibitors - Entacapone, Levodopa, Cabidopa</h2>
<hr />
<pre><code>&gt; Dopamine is mostly made in CNS.
    - If dopamine is not stored it can be inactivated by COMT
    &gt; Dopamine is a norepi precursor. It cannot cross the BBB.
        - This means that if there is degeneration of Dopamine production in the brain, peripheral Dopamine cannot rescue it because it cannot cross BBB.
        - L-DOPA can cross the BBB, but COMT and DD quickly degrade it.
        - Treatment revolves around inhibiting COMT and DD so that L-DOPA can cross the BBB.
&gt; Entacapone:
    - Drug that inhibits COMT. This enhances the conversion of L-DOPA to DA.
    - No effect on DD, so efficacy is fairly low.
    - Drug has low CNS penetration, so it will not have effect on the brain.
    - We combine with Levodopa, which is not an inhibitor of any of these enzyme on its own.
&gt; Levodopa:
    - Not an enzyme inhibitor.
    - Levodopa enhances the effect of Entacapone.
    - Levodopa can cross the BBB.
    - It is similar (synthetic) to L-Dopa, so it saturates COMT and DD in the CNS.
    - This allows for more L-Dopa to cross BBB and get converted to DA.
&gt; Carbidopa:
    - DD inhibitor.
    - Unable to cross BBB.
    - Can be combined with Levodopa again.
    - **Carbidopa + Levodopa is the Gold Standard for Parkinsons Disease**

<h2 id="reuptake-inhibitors-net-amphetamine-methamphetamine-lisdexamphetamine-dextroamphetamine">Reuptake Inhibitors - NET: Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, Lisdexamphetamine, Dextroamphetamine</h2>
<hr />
<pre><code>&gt; Amphetamine, Methamphetamine:
    - Liposoluble, good bioavailability, long duration of action.
    - Penetrate the BBB
    - MoA is Inhibition of Norepinephrine Transporter - NET.
        - Blocks uptake of Norepi, allowing it to accumulate in the synaptic cleft and continue its action.
        - Also enters nerve through NET and transports into vesicles through VMAT.
        - This causes Norepinephrine to displace out from the vesicle, where it can be released through reverse transport!
    - Overall effect of NET inhibition is an  ↑↑↑ of NE in the cleft, so an enhanced stimulant action.
    - Peripheral: B1 and A1 primarily
        - Tachycardia (B1)
        - Vasoconstriction (A1)

    - Therapeutic:
        - Treat narcolepsy, ADHD, Binge eating
    - Adverse:
        - CNS stimuli: jitters, **insomnia, anorexia**, seizures, hallucination, paranoia.
        - PNS: headace, **tachyarrhytmias, hypertension**/hypotension, sweating, nausea, diarrhea,
</code></pre>
<h2 id="reuptake-inhibitors-dat-and-net-cocaine">Reuptake Inhibitors - DAT and NET: Cocaine</h2>
<hr />
<pre><code>&gt; Cocaine:
    - Penetrates BBB
    - MoA: DAT and NET inhibition. This increases the amount of both NE and DA in the synaptic cleft and therefore enhance the stimulant action of both.
    - In particular, it inhibits the reuptake in pleasure centers of CNS.
        - Sympathomimetic effect in PNS. The reuptake is also blocked in PNS, but its less exciting.
    &gt; Therapeutic:
        - Pretty limited. Only used as a local anesthetic.
        - No systemic effect. Only used topically (damn, not even orally)
        - Combine anesthetic and vasoconstriction (sympathomimetic)
    &gt; Adverse effects:
        - Sudden death (**cardiac and respiratory arrest**). 
        - Non-fatal effects: **agitation, paranoia, tachycardia and hypertension**, seizures, angina pectoris/myocardial ischemia, and hyperthermia.
        - Repeated “snorting” can result in chronic rhinitis, cartilaginous necrosis, sinusitis, and **nose bleeds**.

<hr />
<pre><code>&gt; Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCA)
    - Inhibit the Norepinephrine transporter at pre-synaptic terminals in the CNS
    - Also inhibit the 5-HT transporters.
    - Both NE and 5HT accumulate in synaptic cleft, and mostly in CNS, so they stimulate the mood.
    &gt; Therapeutic:
        - Used to treat depression, peripheral neuropathy, and chronic pain.
    &gt; Additional Mechanism:
        - Antagonist of serotonergic, A1, histamine, and muscarinic receptors.
        - These could potentially lead to adverse effects.
    &gt; Adverse Effects:
        - CNS: Confusion and hallucinations (antimuscarininc)
        - Periphery: 
            - Postural hypotension (orthostatic) due to A1-adrenergic antagonism.
            - Atropine-like effects (antimuscarinic)
            - Sinus tachycardia, urinary retnetion, dry **mouth** (due to antimuscarinic).
</code></pre>
<h2 id="releasing-agent-tyramine">Releasing agent: Tyramine:</h2>
<hr />
<pre><code>&gt; Not a drug, but plays a role in drug interaction.
    - Endogenous by-product of tyrosine metabolism. The amount of tyramine generated endogenously is not significant (only traces).
    - Found in high concentrations in some fermented foods (**cheese, wine**, etc..)
    - When foods containing tyramine are ingested, **tyramine is inactivated (metabolized) by MAO in the liver and GI tract** (rapid first-pass metabolism). 
        - Thus, normally, tyramine is not found in the systemic circulation.
&gt; Tyramine is not given to patients.
    - In animals when administered the effect was enhancing imipramine and amyitriptyline because tyramine releases catecholamines from nerve endings.
&gt; Route:
    - Tyramine gets absorbed in the gut and then the blood and gets taken up by sypathetic nerve endings through NET.
    - Transported into vesicles by VMAT.
    - Displaces NE from vesicles.
    - Our patient is on MAO inhibitors, so there is no enzyme available to degrade the excess NE.
&gt; **Can cause a hypertensive crisis.**

<h2 id="mixed-adrenergic-mimicking-drugs">Mixed Adrenergic Mimicking Drugs</h2>

<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Heteroreceptor
    - Receptors that are stimulated by agents other than catecholamines
Autoreceptor
    - Respond to NT&rsquo;s released from their own nerve ending.
    - Stimulation of these can inhibit further release
    - A2 most common autoreceptor. Inhibit catecholamine release.
    - B2 in pre-synaptic. Facilitates catecholamine release.
    - A lot more A2 than B2.
Serotonin
Pathway of Tyrosine to Catecholamine:
    1. Tyrosine transported into the cell
    2. Converted into L-dopa by Tyrosine Hydroxylase
    3. L-Dopa converted to Dopamine by Dopa Decarboxylase DD 
    4. Dopamine can be converted into NorEpi by Dopamine Beta Hydrozylase
    5. If not converted by DBH, then dopamine stored in vesicle by Vesicular Monoamine Transporter VMAT </p>
