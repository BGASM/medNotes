Adenoviridae - Adenovirus
- Two genera: Avian and Mammalian
- Double-stranded, linear virus. 30-40 kb in length.
  - Huge compared to RNA virus.
- Genome is associated with 5' terminal protein and DNA binding protein.
- Capsid: icosahedron (60-90nM *medium*)
  - Contain fiber protein. *attachment*
- Non-enveloped.
- DNA:
  - Can use either strand to make RNA.
    - *- and + RNA)
    - high amount of dsRNA: **interferon induction**
- Replication:
  - Enter: Receptor Mediated Endocytosis
  - Needs access to host nucleus.
  - Early gene products are transcribed and translated using host proteins.
    - Initial Proteins will:
      - Activate viral gene expression
      - **Induce host cell enter S phase**
      - Block apoptosis
      - Inhibit interferon response that the *viral dsRNA induced*.
    - In a permissive cell viral early gene expression is followed by viral DNA replication.
    - *This uses the 5' terminal protein as a **primer***
    - Replication is followed by expression of *late genes*. Late genes encode *structural proteins* of the virus.
    - Structural proteins are made in cytoplasm, but then need to go back into the nucleus.
    - Enough virus particles accumulate, causes *lysis*
    - Can also go *latent*
  - At least 47 serotypes divided into 6 groups (A-F)
  - Cause **respiratory disease, conjunctivitis, hemorrhagic cystitis, gastroenteritis.**
  - Different classifications due to difference in **penton base and fiber protein.**
  - Lytic infection of mucoepithelial cells in respiratory/**GI tract** and conjunctiva.
  - Latent infection in lymphoid.
  - Stable to drying, detergent, and GI.
  - Spread: Aeorsol/Contact/Fecal-Oral
  - 5% of URI and 10% hospitalizations in children may be due to adenovirus.
  - Cause of **croup**
  - Cause of **fulminant respiratory failure**
  - Disea/Outbreak associated with Serotype
    - 3,4,7,14 - Acute respiratory disease
  - Treatment:
    - No specific antiviral drug for adenovirus
    - Some broad-spectrum antiviral are effective
      - esp. in immune compromised patients.
    - Vaccine **WAS** serotype 4,7,21 and was just for military in 1990
 Parvoviridae
 - Smallest DNA virus.
 - Single stranded DNA. 5.5 kb in length, inverted repeats at end
 - 2 genus
   - Erythrovirus: **B19**
   - Dependovirus: AAV - Require a helper virus to grow. in this case, Adenovirus
 - DNA:
   - Inverted Repeats are critical for DNA synthesis.
   - Enter: Receptor Mediated Endocytosis
   - Need to make some dsDNA
   - Both + and - DNA can continue the cycle.
 - One of the "Six Classic Childhood Rashes"
   - *5th Disease: Parvovirus B19.
     - Can also infect dogs...
     - Primary replication in respiratory tract, followed by replication in bone marrow. It infects and kills replicating erythroid precursosrs.
     - Comples precipitate in skin and joints causing rash
     - Rash on both cheeks "face slap"
     - No treatment.
 - Aplastic Crisis:
   - Parvo replicates in red blood cell precurusors
   - In Patients with chronic hemolytic anemia (sickle cell) aplastic crisis can occur.
   - Can be life-threatening.
Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)
- Small, non-envelope, icosahedral
- Double strand, circular DNA.
- **Replicate lytically** in permissive cells
- DNA can persist in *integrated* or *unintegrated (episomal) forms.
- In persistnetly infected cells it stimulates ell proliferation.
  - Warts:
    - 
  - Something else
- Transformation:
  - E1 binds DNA at ori and promotes viral DNA replication.
  - E2 binds DNA and helps E1, activate viral mRNA synthesis
  - E5 - activate epidermal growth factor (oncoprotein)
  - E6: Binds tumor suppressor p53 and targets it for degredation.
  - E7: Bind tumor suppressor pRb.
- Diagnose:
  - Papanicolau stain (pap smear)
  - Detect perinuclear vaculolated cytoplasm, which is a sign of cancer and HPV infection.
  - PCR
Polyomaviruses
- Small (45nm) non-enveloped, DNA viruses
- Circular, double strand of 5kb.
- BK and JC
- Respiratory Tract > Kidney > Latent in Immunocompetent | Reactivation in immunocompromised
- BK causes viruira and hemorrhagic
- CS causes ###
Merkel Cell Virus MCV
- ds DNA, a polyoma virus
- Common in older children and adults
- *Integration* of MCV genome is cause of rare but aggressive **skin cancer**
- Increased incidence in elderly and immunocompromised
