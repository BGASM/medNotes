## Pathways of entery and the stages of viral infection in humans
Viral life cycle
Tropism
Acute vs Chronic
And pathogenicity

Learning about interferon in antiviral defense
Humoral and cellular immunity
Vaccination and antiviral drugs
Methods for detection and Diagnosis

Pathways:
Respiratory, alimentary, urogenital, lesions, conjuctiva, direct blood, bites, arthropod bites

Enveloped viruses in general are more sensitive to dessication, pH, detergent  AND require direct contact via blood, aerosols.
Non-enveloped in general are more resistant.
e.g. ENterovirus can withstand acid environment of the stomach

### Stages
Entry
Initiation of infect at primary site
Activation of protection/immunity
REplication at primary site
Some virus replicate in secondary target organ
Infection of final target tissue
Host responses that can limit or contribute (immunopathogenesis)
Release/shedding of virus
Resolution of infectior or persistent infection


## General Characteristics of Viral infection
Infection is cell type and species specific
Types of cells taht can be infected == tissue tropism of virus
Determinants of tropism == receptors, enzymes, environmnet
Cells that a virus can reproduce in == Permissive
Infection of cells can lead to **abortive infection**
Successfully infected cells can be lytic or non-lytic
Lytic leads to cell death
Non-lytic can produce virus == budding
Non-lytic can be dormant.
Both styles of non-lytic are considered **peristently infected**
Temporary infection == acute
Persistent == chronic
Persistent can lead to constent shedding OR the virus may be latenet. If latent, can see NO free virus, but still infected.

## Mechanisms of Viral Pathogenesis
Direct killing == lysis, inhib protein synth, altered membrane/function
Direct infect of immune cells == immunodef
Indirect effects on immune system
Immunopathology == inflamm, fever, edema, vascular permeability
Oncogenic transformation == virus can express oncogenes and cause cancer

### Host Defense: Innate
Cytokines
Interferon Alpha/Beta important agianst viral infect
Virally infected cells induced to make IFN A or B
DS RNA is a signal to induce IFN synth
IFN binds to receptors on infect and uninfect cells
Binding IFN results in antiviral state
If infect, antiviral state activated to interrupt viral life cycle
Other cells are now primed to defend against infect.
- PKR is a kinase activated by DS RNA or by IFN
  - Activated PKR phosphorylates eIF2a translation which inhibits tranlsation and leads to block of both viral and host protein synthesis
- RNase L also induced by IFN.
- Needs oligo A to activate
- Oligo A induced by IFN and activated by DS RNA
  - Degrades viral and cellular RNA
- RNaseL and PKR inhibit viral replication
Summary:
** PKR and OLIGOA synthesized in inactive form in response to IFN. Both enzymes activated if DS RNA, which happens during viral infect**


### Humoral Immunity:
Effective agianst extracellular stage
Neutralizing antibodies prevent virus from enter or replicating in cells.
  - Block attachment, penetration, membrane fusion, or uncoating
Ab coating viruses can induce opsonization
Enveloped virus coated in Ab can be lysed by complement
Virally infeccted cells can be lysed by commplement, or NK cells using ADCC (antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity)
Limits: Not as effective in late infect
Ab alone not sufficient to confer long term immunity

### Cellular Immunity:
Tcells recognize forein ag on mhc i or ii
When cells are infected, new foreign viral proteins get boudn to mhc i and presented
Activation requires 2 signals: Ag binding and CD4 activation

### Viral Evasion:
Rapid acute infection, adaptive doesnt have time
Ag variation
Restricted or no expression of viral gene products
Active suppression of MHC1
Infect cells that do not normally express MHCi
Decrease cell adhesion molecule so T cell cannot bind and interact
Kill or suppress immune cells


## Immunization:
Neutralizing Ab block early stages
Subsequent infect elicit stronger secondary immune response
Break infection-spread cycle

### Attenuated Live Viral Vadccines:
Use related nbut non-pathogenic version of virus
Or attneuated strains of virus
Stimulate both humoral and cellular immune system and confer long term immunit
Sometimes even attenuated can cause disease
Can revert to virulence

### Killed (Inactivated) Viral Vaccine
Virus inactivated by chemical or physical without destroying antigenicity
Require adjuvants and multiple dose
Inefficient for immune response and long term immunity
Safe

### Subunit Vaccine:
Purified viral proteins used as immunogen
Involkves cloning the gene of interest in a vector and using heterologus cell to produce the protein

### Recombinant Viral Vaccine
Gene encoding a viral antigen that is target of neutralizing Ab is cloned into a non-virulent viral vector

DNA/RNA Base vaccine

### Vaccine Limitations:
– Attenuated strains may be difficult to develop.
– Inactivation may destroy antigenicity.
– Purified proteins may not be immunogenic.
– Virus may “mutate” or evolve too rapidly.


### Anti-Viral Drugs
Identify drugs that inhibti viral replication without harming human host
Targetr any stage of viral life cycle
