## Overall Goals
- Understand fundamenta l structure, classification and replication cycle of viruses
- Understand biologya and PathogenesisUnderstand host-defense strategies
- How virus undermine these defenses
- How medications can interfere
### Definitions
- Infectious
- Obligate intracellular
- Lack a metabolism
- Submicroscopic - 25nm-000'sn,
- Filterable
- No division for replication.

### Classification
- Morphology - Size, shape, envelope
- Genome size, RNA/DNA, +- strand
- Proteins
- Genome organization and replication strategy
- Antigenic properties and serological relations
- Biological properties and structural

Virus Structure Summary
ALl 

- Viral Genome DNA Structure
- Range in size from 5-200 kb
- Linear or circular structure
- Double or single stranded
- Can have unusual structure, such as a Gapped Circle

## RNA
- Double stranded Linear
- SIngle stranded LinearPositive sense +
  - 5-3 directly translated )genome is like mRNA)
-Negative Sense or - strand is
  - Ambisense: RNA that is in part of positive and in part of negative polarity
- RNA can have segmented genomes
- Circular single stranded RNA are found in the viroids and the hepatitis delta virus HDV

## Capsid
- Usually one of two repeated structures:
    - Helix
    - Icosahedron
- Composed of structural subunits called protomers
- Morphological units are called capsomers, these cluster around an axis of symmetry.
- May also have spikes that project from the surgace
- **Protomers are the structural units, capsomers are the functional units**

Virus Attachment to Host

## Receptor Mediated Endocytosis
- Virus binds to receptor at cell surface in areas called coated patients
- Pinches off and forms a coated vesicles
- Endsome can then fuse with others
- Acidification
## Other Surface Entry
- Membrane fusion (enveloped) or pore/channel formation (non-enveloped)
- Receptor 

## Uncoating and Targetting
- Can be partial or complet
- Some viruses, including most DNA virus, must be targeted

## Replication/Gene Strategies
- Class I - VI
- VII: Double stranded DNA with an RNA intermediate (Hepatitis B Virus)
  
## Gene Expression/Replication of DNA Viruses
