## Herpesvirus
Composed of three subfamilies that are distinguished from each other by genome structure and biological activity.
- Alpha: HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV
- Beta: CMV, HHV-6, HHV-7
- Gamma: EBV, HHV-8
Members are:
  - **Herpes Simplex Virus HSV**
  - **Varicella-Zoster Virus VZV**
  - Epstein-Barr Virus EBV
  - Cytomegalovirus CMV

### Genome
dsDNA 100-250kb
Often contain terminal and or **inverted repeat sequences** that result in different **isomeric forms**.
Protein core
Icosahedral capsid
**Tegument** matrix which is unique to Herpes
Envelope that is made up of host cell lipids and viral proteins

### Replication Cycle
1. Attachment: specific envelope glycoproteins bind surface receptors
  - gB, gC, gD for HSV-1
  - gC and gB bind to **herparin sulfate**
  - gD binds to three entry receptors, including herpesvirus entry mediator **(HVEM), nectin-1, 3-O sulfated heparan sulfate**
  - when bound to HVEM gD changes conformation and interact with gH and gL, forming a complex that results in hemifusion state. This facilitates creation of entry pore.
2. **Nucleocapsid + Tegument enter cytoplasm via:**
  - Receptor mediated endocytosis or
  - Direct membrane fusion
3. Capsid are targetted to nuclear pores along with DNA, proteins, and some tegument
4. **Linear genome gets circularized in nucleus**
5. **Immediate Early (IE)/(alpha)** gene expression uses host RNA pol and transcription factors + **virus-encoded transcription activation factor VP16**, a tegument protein
6. IE gene products activate transcription of **early (beta)** genes. Beta genes make enzymes needed for DNA replication
7. Replication of DNA begins.
  - Herpesvirus makes a bunch of enzymes to facilitate replication. These **enzymes are great anti-viral drug targets.**
  - DNA polymerase, thymidine kinase
8. **Late (gamma)** genes are expressed, which encode the structural proteins of the virus.
9. Capsid and tegument proteins get translated and transported into nucleus, where they package DNA into new **nucleocapsids**
10. Envelope made in ER and sent to host membrane
11. Newly formed virus bud through nuclear membrane
12. Release can be through **lysis, exocytosis, direct cell-cell fusion**
''' 
Summary:
Herpesvirus binds to heparin sulfate with its g binding proteins. It makes an entry pore and enters cytoplasm. Nucleocapsid and tegument go to nucleus. Alpha (IE) genes get expressed using host machinery and VP16. Alpha activate transcription of Beta genes. Beta genes make DNA replication enzymes.
Replication begins, eventually expressing gamma genes. Gamma genes code structural proteins. Capsid + tegument get translated and brought to nucleus to wrap around some DNA and make baby nucleocapsids. Envelope proteins get sent to ER. New virus can exit through lysis, exocytosis, or direct cell-cell fusion.
'''
### Latency
Herpesviruses can establish latent infection, primary in **neurons**
Early stage of latent look the same as early stage of productive.
Viral DNA persists episomally (not integrated), very little viral gene expression
- No viral proteins detected
- Several RNA are produced, **Latency Associated Transcripts (LATS)**
Latent virus can reactivate under stress conditions
### HSV and Disease
Initial infec and lytic replication takes place in:
  - **Mucoepithelial cells**
Can spread in host via **syncytia formation (cell-cell fusion)**
  - Allows evasion of Ab.
  - If reaches innervating neurons, can establish latent infection.
Latent virus can be reactivated in neuron by cell stress:
  - Trauma, fever, UV light
Progeny virus travel down nerve and cause **lesions** at site of initial infection.
Disseminated infection in newborns and **rarely encephalitis in adults**
HSV-1 and HSV2 can both cause envephalitis
Symptoms include **painful blisters or ulcers** at site of infection
Recurrent herpes is less **severe and focused**
Whitlow are little white spots on skin
Transmission is by **direct contact**
- Virus sheds in tears and genital secretion
- **HSV1 mostly orally transmitted**
- **HSV2 mostly sexual transmission**
- Infection with HSV2 increases risk of getting and transmitting HIV
TORCHES virus: congenitally accquired infections that cause morbidity and mortality in neonates
- **To**xoplasmosis gondii
- **R**ubella
- **C**ytomegalovirus
- **He**rpes
- **S**yphillis

### Diagnosis
Viral cultures:
- Cytopathic effect (CPE)
- Ballooning of cells
Tzanck Smear:
- Biopsy from herpetic lesion
- Multinucleated giant cells
- Nuclear inclusions (cowdry type A)
Serology and PCR
### Treatment - Nucleoside Analogues
Acyclovir is a guanosine analogue lacking ribose or deoxyribose
 - **Chain terminator**
 - Selective agaisnt HSV and VZV
 - **Viral Thymidine Kinase** phosphorylate Acyclovir
 - Humans make TK also, but our TK doesnt turn Acyclovir on well.
### Other Human Herpesviruses: Varicella-Zoster
Alpha herpesvirus
**VZV is the cause of chicken pox**. If *reactivated* causes **shingles (herpes zoster)**
### VZV Pathogenesis
Enter and replicate in **respiratory tract** and spread to lymphoid cells
Travel to skin and cause **maculopapular rash**
*Centripetal distribution*
Progress to **papules/vesicles** that get **crusty**
**Can become latent in neurons.**
### VZV Complications
Secondary bacterial superinfections
**Hemorrhagic chickenpox**
Devastating to immunocompromised
### VZV Clinical Manifestation
Latency in sensory ganglia
Reactivated virus leads to herpes zoster
Chicken pox like vesicles eventually appear over the **dermatome**
-   Cranial Nerve VII (bells palsy)
-   Cranioal Nerve VII (Ramsay Hunt)
Can cause Ocular Zoster
Diagnosis similar to HSV
- Cowdry Type A nuclear inclusions: **Tzanck Smear**
- Virus culture, serology
### VZV Treatment
Vaccination:
- Children: Low dose Live attenuated vaccine
- Adults: Zostavax: Higher dose shingles live attenuated vaccine (after age 50)
- Shingrix: Recombinant vaccine. Two dose, more effective for shingles and post-herpetic neuralgia. (after age 50)
## Epstein Barr Virus
Causes **Infectious Mononucleosis**
ENV os a **gamma-herpesvirus**
Infects **B cells** and some oropharynx epithelial cells.
- Uses **complement component receptor** CR2/CD21
- Lytic, latent, immortalization of B cells all possible
In non-permissive cells, EBV genome is **circular and express limited number of genes**
- EBNA (Epstein=Barr Nuclear Antigens)
  - EBNA1: Maintain presence of viral genome
  - EBNA2: **Stimulate b cell proliferation** genes
  - EBNA3: **inactivate Rb tumor suppressor**
- LMP (latent membrane proteins) stimulate proliferation
### EBV Pathogenesis
Transmission via saliva
Infected host can shed virus for life
Symptoms of Mononucleosis:
- lymphadenopathy
- splenomagaly
- pharyingitis
- fever, malaise
- meningencephalitis, guillain-barre
- laryngeal obstruction, splenic rupture
### EBV Tumor Pathogenesis
EBV associated with B cell lymphoma and leukemia in immunocompromised
Burkitt lymphoma: Tumor of jaw and face in children
- Tumors contain EBV DNA
- Endemic Variant
- Sporadic Type
- Immune Deficiency associated: HIV
- Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which included burkitt, accounts for 30-50% childhood lymphoma
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma:
- Tumors of the upper respiratory tract
- Endemic in Asia, Alaska, Tunisia, East Africa
### EBV Diagnosis/Treatment
CBC w/ differential looking for atypical lymphocytes
## Cytomegalovirus - Large Cell causing Virus
