- Also, understand Rubella Virus (+ RNA)
Orthomyxovirus:
- Influenza A B C
- HA, NA, M2 proteins
- Host Cell Receptor for Influenza
- Antigenic drift vs shift
### General Features of RNA-
Viral genome does not serve as mRNA
Contain RDRP protein
- Used to synthesize an RNA+ strand **before** protein synthesis
- Generally replicate in cytoplasm **except for orthomyxo**
## Paramyxovirus
Minus strand, non-segmented genome
Measels, Mumps, Parainfluenza, Pneumovirus (RSV)
### Replication
Enter make some RNA-, shed coat, begin transcription of RNA-
Make template, RNA+ and also mRNA
RNA+ can be used to make viral RNA-
The mRNA can translate into proteins
### Parainfluenza
Transmission: Respiratory secretion, aerosols, fomites
Multiplication occurs in **tracheobronchial tree**
4 serotypes
Common cause of respiratory disease in children
major cause of croup
No vaccine
## RSV
Primarily a childhood infection
'common cold' infections occur between Jan-Mar
Yearly epidemic
Transmission: aerosol, fomites
### RSV Pathogenesis
Incubateion 2-8 days
Enter through eye/nose
Spread along **respiratory tract via cell-cell transfer**
URI: fever, rhinitis, cough
Severe infection in pre-term infant and neonate
### RSV Diagnosis and Treatment
**Nasal washing/nasal aspirate or swab** - antigen testing, PCR, or culture
No vaccine
Treat with Ribovirin
- Guanosine Analogue
RSV immunoglobulin MAB given to high risk
## Mumps
ssRNA- in helical nucleocapsid with envelope
Related to parainfluenza
Transmission via respiratory secretions
Replicate in epithelium of upper respiratory
Primary cause of Parotitis
1 serotype, life-long immunity
Fuse cell membranes - cell-cell transmission and **syncytia formation**
T cell response necessary for clearance, but contribute to morbidity
**Swelling of salivary gland**
### Mumps Diagnosis/Prevention
Best method of diagnosis is serology
- Ab titers
Prevention via MMR vaccine which is a live attenuated vaccine
## Measles
Mumps is #1 childhood rash/disease
Enveloped, ssRNA- paramyxovirus
Transmission: respiratory secretions
**Highly Contagious Disease**
PT contagious 7 dyas prior to, and 3-4 days after symptoms
### Manifestation
Prodromal Stages
- Fever, malaise, sneezing, conjunctivitis, cough
Koplik's Spots
- appear in mouth
Maculopapular rash
- 10 days after exposure
- Whole body
### Pathogenesis   
Inoculate and replicate in respiratory tract
Lymphatic spread
Viremia to rest of body
Eyes, urinary, blood vessels, CNS, lymphatics
Virus infected endothelial cells + T cells lead to rash
### Diagnosis and Prevention
Microscopy: Multinucleated Giant Cells
Serology, PCR, Immunofluorescence
Treatment: No antiviral, can treat with immunoglobulin within 6 days
Prevention: MMR vaccine
Leading cause of death of young children worldwide
## Rubella
Rubella is #3 childhood disease
Enveloped, ssRNA+, non-segmented (but similar disease as measels)
### Pathogenesis
Transmission: respiratory secretion
Incubates 13-20 days
Enter and infect nasopharynx
Spread to **lymph nodes, monocytes, macrophages**
Viremia
**Virus Can infect placenta and spread to fetus**
### Clinical Manifestations
Children and Adults see **low grade fever, rash, sore throat**
Maculopapular rash
Adults: **Arthritis and arthralgia more severe**
### Congenital Rubella
Congenital Infection: **TORCH**
Hearind loss/deafness
Heart defects
Ophthalmic
Intrautering Growth Restriction
Thrombocytopenic purpura (blueberry muffin)
Hepatomegaly/splenomegaly
### Diagnosis and Treatment
No specific antiviral
Serology to detect
**Prevent with MMR**e
### Orthomyxoviridae
Three member family: Influenza A B C
Enveloped RNA- segmented genome
Envelope contains 2 glycoprotein (most RNA virus have 1): **hemagglutinin - HA and neuraminidase NA**
8 different segments of RNA
1-3 PB1 PB2 PA -> transcriptase proteins, needed for transcription
4 HA -> Hemagglutinin needed for viral attachment to host
5 NP -> Nucleoprotein: RNA binding, part of transcriptase
6 NA -> Neuraminidase: Cleaves sialic acid and promotes virus release
7 M2 -> Integral membrane protein, needed to form membrane channel

### life Cycle
Ha protein serves as both viral attachment and fusion protein
**HA binds sialic acid**
- Human strain bind sialic acid alpha 2,6 linkage while avian binds alpha 2,3 linkage
Entry via **receptor mediated endocytosis**
- Acidification of endocytic vesicles induce shape change in HA protein that induces fusion
- Viral envelope fuses with endosomal membrane, releaseing nucleocapsid
**HA protein forms trimer**
Nucleocapsid targetted to nucleus
RNA segments each transcribed into mRNA using viral transcriptase **PA, PB1, PB2**
Most mRNA encode single protein **except segments 7 and 8**
Viral mRNA translated in cytoplasm or ER
Envelope HA and NA and M2 proteins inserted into membrane
RNA is replicated - strand to +, back to - strand
Genome segments transported to cytoplasm, where tehy associate with polymerase and NP proteins to make nucleocapsid
Capsid migrate to plasma membrane and incorporates the envelope proteins
Virus released from cell by budding:
- **NA cleaves sialic acid and allow release of new viral particle**
### Diagnosis
Rapid Influenza Diagnostic Test RIDT
- Antigen testing
- detect A or B nuceloprotein antigen in resp samples
- Rapid, limited sensitivity
  Vulture/PCR to confirm
### Treatment
**Symmetrel and Flumadine - Neutralize pH of endosome** and block the channel formed by M2 protein. Blocks uncoating and translocation of nucleocapsid to nucleus.
- **no effect on influenza B and C. Many A strains resistant**
**Relenza and Tamiflu: Block Neuraminidase activity**, which is needed for release from cell surface.
- Effective on Influenza A and B
- Can be used prohpylactically or early infection to reduce duration of illness.
### Drift vs Shift
Influenza A mutates faster than B, which is faster than C
HA and NA proteins majore antigenic determ.
Named by type, origin, date and HA/NA antigen: **A/Bangkok/1/79(H3N2)**
### Drift is mutation of genome due to errors during replication:
- Usually point mutation
- Result of RNA polymerase errors (no proofreading on RNA pol)
- HA and NA drigts most important
- Occur in Influ. A B and C, but **A has highest rate**
- Result in gradual changes over time, cause of **yearly epidemics**
- Between 1973 and 1982, five antigenic variants emerged
- Antigenic drift occurs regularly. Antigenic variation is thought to occur as a result of antibody pressure in the population.
### Shift is reassortment of genome segments
Reassortment of genome segments results in dramatic change in antigenicity
Several different viruses from different sources can infect same animal.
**Shift refers to exchange of HA or NA segments between two different strains**
Influenza A serotypes:
- HA has 18, NA has 11.
- Two subtypes are currently in general circulation for humans: H1N1 and H3N2
- Birds have infected humans: H5, H7, H9
- So example of shift is Duck: H5N1 and Human: H3N2 -> H5N2 reassortment in pigs.
- **'Swine flue' H1N1**
- Can infect both a2,3 and a2,6 linkages
- Can infect healthy people
- Genetic shift result of quadruple reassortment
  - Two genes form european and asian pigs
  - 1 gene from birds
  - 1 gene from humans
Nobody had antibodies to this thing.
```
Summary: 
Antigenic drift leads to annual influenza epidemics.
Antigenic SHIFT leads to worldwide pandemics.
```
### Avian Influenza Bird Flu in Asia
Virus spread from poultry to humans
Human-human transmission is rare, but happened
Spread is still primarily bird-bird, but this strain was able to expand to humans.
HA of H5N1 binds a2,3 linkages, which are rarely present in human URT
### Seasonal Influenza Vaccine
Normal vaccine is formalin inactivated. 
Live Attenuated Vaccine: LAIV: FluMist
Current LAIV4 contains:
A/Michigan/45/2015 H1N1
A/Singaper/INFIMH-16-0019/2016(H3N2)
