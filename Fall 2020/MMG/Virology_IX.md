## Prions
PRNP is human gene encoding for major prion protein PrP, also known as CD230
Predominant expression in nervous system
Multiple isoforms:
- Normal PrPc 
- Protease resistant forms PrPres
  - Such as PrPSc (scrapie)
- Misfolded version of PrPSc is associated with a variety of cognitive disorders and neurodegenerative diseases
  - Animals: Bovine Scrapie, BSE, Mad Cow Disease
  - Humans: Creuzfeldt-Jakob (CJD) Fatal Familial Insomnia (FFI) etc.
PRNP gene located in short arm of chromosome 20, at position 13.
### PrP
C terminal globular domain with three alpha helices
Two strand antiparallel B sheet
Disordered N terminal domain
Glycophosphatidylinositol GPI membrane anchor at the COOH terminal and tethers PrP to cell membrane
- This is integral to transmission of conformational change
- Prion protein is located in lipid rafts and attached to the outer leaflet of the cellular membrane via a GPI-anchor. 
- The flexible Nterminal part of the protein – among other features – harbors a neurotoxic domain and is able to bind copper ions and oligomeric amyloid β (purple triangles). 
- The C-terminal part of PrPC has a globular structure and comprises up to two N-glycan side chains. 
- Involvement of PrPC in protective or toxic signalling (dotted thunderbolt) requires accessory molecules (not shown) to bypass the lipid bilayer
### PrPc Normal Isoform
Possibly involved in transport of ionic copper to cells from surrounding environment.
### PrPsc Scrapie Isoform
Conformational isoform of PrPc.
This isoform tends to accumulate protease-resistant aggregates within neural tissue.
- Identical primary structure, but the secondary and tertiary structure are different.
### Prion Diseases
**Spongiform encephalopathies** - large vacuoles in brain
**Dementia**, loss of motor control, paralysis, **wasting**
Infections (TSE) or genetic (familial)
- Scrapie -> Sheep
- BSE -> Cattle
- Chronic Wasting Disease -> Deer
Kuru:
- Shivering or trembling
- Infection due to cannibalistic handling and ingestion of brain from dead relatives
- Women and children more commonly infected
