RNA - bring their own polymerases. Also all single stranded.
Orthodontist office painted orange. It is night time, the moon is out and there are clouds in front of it. **RNA-**
Orthodontist is wearing a lab coat. **Enveloped**
FLU-oride is as easy as ABC poster on the wall. **Influenza A B C**
There is an aquarium in the office. There is an octopus in there and she has little baby octopi inside a diver helmet. **Replicate inside the nucleus. Only RNA virus to do this**
Octopus has 8 arms. **Orthomyxo has 8 virus segments. There are only 4 viruses that are segmented: Bunya, Ortho, Arena, Reo. or BOAR**
There is a blackboard, and on it is written Doktor Drift. **Represent antigenic drift due to a point mutation. Drift only cause epidemics. (mispelling of doctor)**
Also on the blackboard is the phrase Night Shift, and the letters are falling off. **Antigenic Shift. This is when mutations get swapped between different strains and is severely worse, leading to pandemics.**
There are multicolored curtains on the windows **Antigenic Variation**

Octopus is sitting ontop of a bunch of RBC rocks and clumping them together. The aquarium is called Heme Aquarium. **Represent hemagluttin (HA) which is a glycoprotein on the surface of influenza that binds to sialic acid on cells or RBC. It causes RBC to clump.**
Plants in the aquarium represent **Sialic acid residues bound by HA**
Octopus has multi-colored suckers, representing **HA Antigens, H1, H2, H3. These determine cell tropism and which species the virus will infect. Anti-HA antigen we make protect us against this virus in the future**
There is a little octopus inside a shell with a crest that looks like M M **M2 Protein shifts pH before virus uncoats**
Manta ray moving in to eat the M2 shell. **Amantadine/Rimantadine inhibits M2 and prevents uncoating, also only works on Influenza A, since B doesn't have M2.**
Octopus mom has a scalpel and she is cutting the sialic acid plants trapping the babies. **Neuraminadase (NA) breaks the sialic acid that now binds the viral babies to the host cell.**
Scalpels for Nurse Assistant. **Reminder that Neuraminadase is NA**
Nurse Tammy V **Tamiflu aka Oseltamivir/Anamivir are NA inhibitors**
Tammy V is putting caps on all the scalpels. **Oseltamivir inhibits virion release.**

Droplets of water splashing out of the aquarium. **Spread via respiratory droplets**
Dec-February is flu season. Vaccine should be around October.
Bubbles in front of a nose shaped rock. **Live attenuated nasal spray**
Little skeleton being stabbed with a syringe: **Killed injectable**

The bib on the patient has two lungs drawn on it. **Pneumonia is a major complication**
Orthodontist is looking into patients mouth with a gold stick **Staph A also causes pneumonia**
Big bottle of aspirin with a skull and crossbones drawn on top. **Aspirin is contraindicated in children with viral illness**
Bottle of aspirin has a man with a red turban, a sun, and a cow with a liver spot. **Reyes Syndrome, aspirin can cause encephalitis, fatty liver, and fever in children infected with virus.**
Stuffed bear on the patients lap. The kid is grabbing the bear by its leg. **Guillane-Baret Syndrome, ascending paralysis**
