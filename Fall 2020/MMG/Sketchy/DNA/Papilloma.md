A little fenced in park with table and some chairs.
Table is blue and green. **DNA**
Statue of David. **Naked**
Two kids outside the fence. THey tell each other their ages. **HPV 1 - 4**
The kids outside the fence are covered in bugs. **Verruca Vulgaris = Cutaneous common wart**
The kids outside the fence probably touched hands while they were playing. **Direct contact**
Inside the park there are two more kids playing with bugs. They wear shirts with '11' and '6' on them. **HPV 11 and HPV 6, they share symptoms.**
Kid in 11 is putting a bug in his mouth. **Laryngeal papillomatosis = recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Not a sexually transmitted disease. HPV 6 can also get this. More common in children and can be present at birth.**
Kid in 6 is dropping a bug down his pants. **Angogenital warts. This is sexually transmitted**
Next to kids 6 and 11 is a jar filled with accumulated bugs. **Condyloma acuminata = anogenital warts from HPV 6 and 11**
Two teenagers at the table looking like they are about to kiss. On the table there is a crab. Next to the guy are car keys, indicating that he is 16 years old. The girl has an I Voted sticker, indicating she is 18. They aren't going to bang until they get married in 15 years. **The teens are HPV 16 and 18. Both of these can lead to anogenital squamous cell carcinomas. Additional squamous cell carcinoma causing HPV strains are 31 and 33.**
Pillbug on the 16yro teen's chair, he is about to sit on it. **Represents the HPV 16, 18, 31, 33 anogenital cancer causing HPV**
The fence has syringes for the pokey parts. **Guardasil, which is a vaccine for HPV 6, 11, 6 and 18. It does not prevent 1-4, which is why the infants are locked outside. It also does not prevent 31 or 33.**
The crab on the table has a fork stabbing into a shrimp, and the prongs and shrim look like E6. There is also a crab cracker on the table with red and white stripes. The stripes represent a checkpoint. The cracker straddles two sides of the table, one half of the table is painted dark blue and the other light blue.  **HPV encodes two proteins, E6 and E7, which promote proteolysis of P53 and Rb. E6 targets p53, whose role is to strop transition from G1 to S phase.**
Also on the table, a fork poking a glass of Root Beer with a bendy straw, representing E7. **RB targets by E7. RB is a tumor suppressor**
**Post-coital bleeding think cervical cancer**
The girl has a smear on her face. **Pap smear - sample cervical cells from transitional zone. HPV cells undergo morphological changes**
Girl has a plate of blue sunnyside eggs with a bunch of extra yolks. **Pap smear looks for koiliocytes, which are large binuceleated cells and they are cervical cells that have undergone morphological changes due to HPV infection.**
Girl wears an AIDS ribbon and has a cane. **Represent that HPV is an AIDS defining illness: invasive cervical/anal/penile cancers. AIDS also enhances HPV's E6 and E7 effects.**
