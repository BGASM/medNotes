Psychadellic tent labeled Hippie Pad **Hepadnavirus family**
Out in a blue/green field with a purple hippy van. **DNA**
Hippies all wearing robes. **Eveloped**
Weve got hippies outside the hippie pad dome and inside the dome. **Replication is both intranuclear and cytoplasmic**
Hippies are sitting in a circle holding hands. Behind them are a bucnh of other hippies standing and holding hands. **Circular DNA that is partially double stranded**
Fortune teller holding spellbook reverso transcriptum **Due to reverse transcriptase: Partial Double DNA-> Single RNA -> Double progeny DNA. Not a Retrovirus! Does not integrate into host genome.**
Hippies holding a sex, drugs, rock and roll sign. **Hep B transmission by sex and blood, mainly by sharing needles**
Baby and the sign-holding woman wear matching red-splattered outfits. **Vertical transmission during delivery. Mothers often bleed significantly during deliver. Important to realize that Hep B does not pass the placenta, transmission is due to contact with labor blood.**
Torches in the field. **TORCHES virus**
Mom and baby sharing a liver shaped cookie. Mom only eats a tiny bit, while the baby gets 90% of it. **Newborns infected with Hep B have a 90% chance of developing CHRONIC infection**
Hippie lady with red beads kneeling. **Polyarteritis Nodosa = systemic vasculitis that effects medium and small arteries, the affected arteries are said to resemble beads on a string. It it being put into a red kidney shaped box because it can affect the kidneys**
Hippie bead lady is covered in henna **Rash purpuric with non-blaching maculoes.**
She is kneeling and it hurts. **Arthralgia**
Red Kidney shaped boxes at her knees. **Kidney issues due to the polyarteritis nodosa as well as due to membranous Glomerular nephritis**
Two big knots in her hand going into the second box. **Knots represent glomerulus. The two knots are associated with membranous glomerulonephritis and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis** 

Hippie adult and hippie baby playing with ALT beach balls. The adult is bopping his ball high into the air. **ALT is higher in viral hepatitis. Alcoholic Hep AST is usually greater than ALT.**
Baby is deflating his ball. **ALT is normal early in neonatal hepatitis**

Titers painted on the side of the van with the words we are all one SpECiES!
S: Red - **HbSAg (Hep B surface Antigen) is the first marker of ifection, either acute or chronic.**
E: Orange - **HbEAg (infectivity) Higher in the begininng of infection.**
Below S and E is a flat tire. **Symptomatic, this is the beginning of the infection**
C: Yellow - **Anti-HBc (Anti Hep B core Antibody) positive during the window period The HbSAf may already be low if you are checking later than onset, but then Anti-HBc may be high.**
E: Green - **Anti-HBe (Anti Hep B e Antibody) will be low if the patient isn't infectious anymore. This will also be delayed, right, since they are an Antibody response that lingers after the infection is resolved.**
S: Blue - **Anti-HBs (Anti-Hep B-Surface Antibody) If this is high it indicated recovery. Acute as well as Chronic. Also checked for immunized persons. An immunized patient will negative for all serology except for Anti HBc.**
Note - **Recovered will be Anti-HBc+ and Anti-HBs+, immunized will be Anti-HBs+ only, and still sick may be Anti-HBe+**

Fortune teller is read tarot cards on a hard liver-shaped rock. She turns over a crab card. **Hep B is associated with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma**

Old Daddy hippie carrying two kids that are wearing orange robes and have orange hair and moon necklaces. They also wear circular head bands. **Hep D is a circular, enveloped RNA- virus. It depends on Hep B to infect.**
The kid holding his dad's hand. **Co-infection. Both Hep D and Hep B are transmitted at the same time.**
Other kid rides his dad's shoulders **Superinfection. WHere Hep D is transmitted after Hep B has already started an infection. They are usually worse**

Banner near Van that says Make Peace Not War. There is a lamb painted on the banner. **Lamivudine**
Under War the she-elf with a flail is painted. **NRTI. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor**
Hippie van has a twisted antenna as well. **Interferion Alpha**

Neonatal baby with the deflated ALT ball is holding a bunch of IgG keys to the hippie van. **Give neonates IgG immunoglobulin.**
