## Family Retroviridae
- Alpha-Epsilonretrovirus and Lentivirus
- Lentivirus
  - Species: HIV-1 and HIV-2
### Morphology
- A Type: Non-enveloped, immature pareticles. Endogenous and non-infectious.
- B Type: Enveloped. Acentric Core
- C Type: Central Core
- D Type: Central and cylindrical core
- Epsilon, Lenti, Spuma all similar to D-Type, but with different core shapes. Lenti is cone shaped, epsi
### Species
- HIV 1 and 2 share 40% sequence homology
- Type 1 predominant form worldwide
- Type 2 prevalent onliy in west africa and is lest virulent.
- Origin: SImian Immunoeficiency virus (SIV) is a primate retrovirus.
### Structure
- RNA+ which *can* function as mRNA, but with HIV it does not.
- Each virion carries 2 identical copes of viral mRNA
- Envelope contains both **transmembrane** and **surface** proteins
### Proviral Genome
- GAG - matrix, capsid, nucleosome
- POL 
- ENV
- ![provirus](https://github.com/BGASM/medNotes/blob/23850cbd41869d2dbb6aa7664824552e90733361/MMG%2Fimg%2Fhivproviral.JPG)
### Life Cycle
- Attachment between gp120 and CD4 followed by interaction with co-receptor CCR5 or CXCR 4
- CD4/CCR5 - R5 virus”, initial infection
- CD4/CXCR4 “X4 virus”, later in infection
- CD4/CXCR4&CCR5 - “X4/R5
- Following receptor/co-receptor binding, gp41 mediates fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane. After membrane fusion, the nucleocapsid is released into the cytoplasm.
- Reverse transcribed into DNA from RNA.
  - **RT is a very error prone process which results in multiple mutant drug resistant strains**
  - RNA strand in hybrid gets digested by RNaseH
  - Second DNA strand gets synthesized using the new DNA as a template
  - Produces a dsDNA known as **proviral DNA**
  - Long-Terminal-Repeat (LTR) formed at each end
  - Proviral DNA enters nucleus and integrates into cell DNA
  - Proviral DNA is replicated now along with the host genome every time the host cells divide.
  - Integrated DNA gets transcribed and translated
  - **Viral promoter and polyadenylation signals** are located in the **LTR**
  - Viral RNA can be used as mRNA or act as knew denomes
    - Some are intact genome, some are subgenomic RNA
    - Some are nucelocapsids
    - Maturation after budding gives rise to viral
### Transmission
- Direct blood contact: transfusions, nbeedles, open wounds
- Sexual intercourse
- Prinatal transmission
### Pathogenesis
- Virus infect CD4 T cells and macrophages
- Also infects dendritic cells
- **T cells lytically infected**
- **Mphage are persisitently infected and serve as a reservoir**
- Loss of CD4 over time
### Clinical Manifestation
- Primary/Acute HIV (2wk - 3mo)
- Initial infection usually due to R5 virus that infects CCR5 cells
- Fever, fatigue, rash, headache, swollen lymph nodes, sore throat
- Some are asympomatic
- Immune system begins to respond by producing **anti-HIV Ab. This process is called sero-conversion.** 
  - Ab testing before this time may miss the virus. This is a **window period**
### Clinically Dormant Stage - Latency
- Can last years without HAART
- Asymp
- **Level of virus in blood decreases and stays at 'steady state'**
### HIV set point
- Reflects a **stabilized HIV viral load** in a person after acute phase has ended
- Higher set point → faster progression to AIDS
- Viral Load > 75000 copies/ml and CD$ < 200 ml

### Time Course
- Lifelong infection
### Opportunistic Infections
- Parasitic
- Toxoplasma gondii
- Cryptosporidium
- Fungal
- Candida albicans
- Cryptococcus neoformans
- Pneumocystis carinii
- Histoplasma capsulatum
- Viral
- CMV
- Herpes Zoster and Herpes Simplex
- EBV
- Bacterial
- Mycobacterium tuberculosis
- Mycobacterium avium-intracellular complex  
- Kaposi Sarcoma HHV-8
  - Purple papular lesions all over body
- Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
- EBV related lymphoma
### Neurological Disease
- AIDS related Dementia
- Virus carried to CNS by monocytes and macrophages
- Microglia and astrocytes get infected
- Slow deterioration of cognitive function
### Diagnostics
- ELISA or Western blot look for presence of p24 (capsid protein)
- PCR
- RT/PCR
- Or assay for Ab to viral proteins by ELISA or Western

## HIV Antiviral Models
- Receptor Blocking
- Fusion inhibition
- Reverser Transcriptase Inhibitors and Nucleoside Analogues
- Protease Inhibitors
- Integrase Inhibitors
- HAART - Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy
### Binding
- CCR5 blockers
- Maraviroc 
- wont work on CSCR4
### Fusion Inhib
- T20 Fuzeon/Enfuvirtide
- Block HIV ability to bind and fuse the viral envelope with cell membrane
- Designed to be used in combo with other.
### Nucleoside Analogue Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors: NRTIs
- AZT thymidine analogue 
- Since it lacks a 3’ OH group, it serves as a chain terminator, thereby blocking the replication cycle.
- Host cell 100 fold less sensitive to AZT than RT
### non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)   
- These drugs bind to RT and block its activity so there is no incorporation of nucleotides. Drugs in this class include: Delavridine (Rescriptor)  Nevirapine (Viramune) Efravirenz (Sustiva)
### Integrase Inhibitors
- Block viral integrase
### Protease Inhibitors
- Interfere with processing of viral proteins.
### Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy, or HAART
- Because HIV can become resistant to any of the drugs currently in use, combination treatments must be used to effectively suppress the virus.
- When multiple drugs (three or more) are used in combination, it is referred to as highly active antiretroviral therapy, or HAART (or just ART).
### Considerations When Choosing HAART
- Use mixture of drugs (typically 3-4) with different mechanisms of action.
- Insure no cross-resistance.
- Minimize side effects to improve compliance.
- Combine drugs into single pill to improve compliance.
- Decrease number of times taken per day to improve compliance.
- Decide when to initiate therapy.
- Conduct genotype and drug resistance testing to guide choice of regimen.
### Treatment Failure
- Signs include Weight loss, anemia, fever, new infections, TB, HSV, CMV
- Continued detection of viral PCR
- Low CD4 count
- Causes could be poor compliance, viral resistence, inadequate drug absorption or suboptimal dosing.
### Immune Reconsitution Syndrome
- Reported in chronically infected HIV-AIDS patients treated with new anti-retroviral combos
- As the immune system begins to recover there is a massive inflammaotry response that makes symptoms worse
### Truvada - Prophylaxis
- Combines two HIV medicines in one pill and is taken to reduce risk of getting HIV.
- Both drugs are **NRTIs** and block reverse transcriptase 
### HTLV
- Retrovirus that causes adult **acute T cell lymphocytic leukemia** ATLL
- Virus is cell associated: spread via blood transfusion, sexual intercourse, or breast feeding
- Infect CD4 t cells
- Tax gene product activates cellular genes encoding T cell growth factos like **IL2**, which may cause **tumor** **formation**
- **Long latent period (30 years) before leukemia**
- Tumor cells contain proviral DNA
- Tumor cells don't awlays express viral protein
- Endemic in parts of Japan
- No treatments exist for acute or chronic HTLV
