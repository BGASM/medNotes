acute vs chronic hepatitis
Hep A B C D E
Reverse transcriptase in Hep B life cycle
Antiviral Treatments for B and C
Co-Infection HBV and HDV
Evolution of Hep B serological profile and apperance of serum markers

## Hepatitis Viruses
Hep A: ssRNA+ Picornavirus
Hep B: dsDNA hepadnavirus
Hep C and G: ssRNA+ flavivirus
Hep D: circular ssRNA- Defective virus requires HBV helper
Hep E: ssRNA+ enteric virus
### Acute Hepatitis
Initial Symptoms:
- Fatigue, fever, joint ache, nausea, vomiting, diargghea
1-2 weeks later:
- Jaundice, Dark urine, elevated AST and ALT
### Chronic Hepatitis
PT may be asymptomatic
Slightly elevate liver enzymes
Hepatomegaly/tenderness
RIsk of long-term liver disease
## Hepatitis A Virus
**Infections Hepatitis**
Picorn
non-enveloped, ssRNA+, stable to acid
Infect liver receptor
**Non-cytolytic**, released by exocytosis
Children asymptomatic, adults show symptoms
**Rarely fatal, no chronic disease**
### HAV Life Cycle
Fecal-oral
Enter bloodstream through **oropharynx or intestine** and then target liver
Virus produced in liver, released into **bile and stool**
CD8 cells lyse infected, enhanced by ADCC
*Liver pathology likely due to host immune response*
Incubation 15-40 days
Abrupt onset of symptoms: AST ALT
*Complete recovery in 99% case within 2-3 weeks*
- *IgG Ab to HAV indicates past infection*
### Epidemiology
40% Acute cases of hepatitis caused by HAV
**Resists detergents, water, acid, high temp**
*Vaccine is available*
## Hepatitis B
**Serum Hepatitis**
Small, enveloped **circular dsDNA** with *single-stranded gaps*
Replicate through RNA intermediate using reverse transcriptase -> DNA -> RNA -> DNA
### Different HBV virions
Initially thought to be genetic disease, Australia antigen
**Dane particles** discovered later
Non-infections **rod shaped or spherical subviral particles also discovered!**
Function of subviral particles unknown. A lot more produced than the viral Dane particles.
**Maybe adsorbing virus-neutralizing Ab?**
### Structure of HBV
Virions are enveloped
Core is nucelocapside with diameter of 28nm
HBsAG domain consists of preS1(Long), preS2(medium), and S(short) surface proteins.
- All three proteins have same C terminal, but different N terminal.
- HBsAg: Surface Coat Protein
- HBcAg: Inner Core Protein
- HBeAg: Secreted
### Structure and replication:
Enter and dump core
Complete dsDNA genome and enter nucleus
Make ssRNA that gets translated and reverse transcribed

### HBV and Disease
Transmitted by blood and sex
Acute or Chronic
**Cell mediated immunity and inflammation**
- Cause acute symptoms
- Can also resolve
**Chronic** infection can lead to **cirrhosis and/or carcinoma**
### Acute Infection
Can resolve
Jaundice and AST ALT release
*More virgorus CD8 response the more severe symptoms, but decreased chance of chronic.*
### HBV Serology
Hep B Surface Antigen: HBsAg - Presence of HBsAg indicates that the person is infectious
Hep B survace Ab: anti-HBs - Presence indactes recovery and immunity
Total Hep B core Ab: anti-HBc - Appears at onset of acute symptoms and persist for life.
IgM Ab to hep B core ag: IgM anti-HBc - indicate recent acute infection
### HBV in Primary Hepatocellular Carcinoma PHC
**More than 50%** PHC case are due to HBV infection
HBV genome in tumor cells and express viral Ag. **Integrated**
Mechanism unknown, but **X gene product Hbx** involved
### Prevention/Treatment
Vaccine: Contain **HBsAg (S gene podcut) recombinant subunit vaccine**
IFN A
Antivirals: Target viral **polymerase/reverse** transcriptase or **nucleoside analogue**
## Hepatitis D
Circular, ssRNA-
Can only infect cells infected with HBV
**Use HBsAg as coat protein (doesn't make its own)**
Immunization for HBV would protect against HDV
Circular genome surrounded by **delta Ag**
**Co-infected** with HBV and HDV or people with HBV can be **superinfected with HDV**
Superinfection more rapid and severe
### Subviral Agents: Satellites and Satellite Viruses
Satellite is subviral agent that depends on coinfection of host with helper virus.
Satellite virus encode structural proteins to encode their genetic material
Satellite nucleic acids, do not encode their own structural proteins, but are encapsulated by their helper viruse
### Subviral Agents: Viroids
Smalles infectious pathogen known
Composed solely of circular ssRNA with no protein coating
Found in plants...?
### Hep D is satellite of HBV
Difference between viroid and HDV is that HDV produces a protein: HDag
HDAg-L LARGE and HDAg-S SMALL
Small is early stage, enters nucleus and supports replication
Large is made later and acts as inhibitor of viral replication, required for assembly of viral particles
HDV may use host RNA pol II during replication.
HDV envelope has three HBV surface proteins anchored to it.
### HDV and AAv: Satellite vs Dependovirus
AAV is adeno-associated virus. It was called adeno-associated satellite
AAV can self-replicate under some events, UV radiation, carcinogens, integrating into host genome.
HDV CANNOT!
## Hepatitis C
Flavivirus
Enveloped ssRNA+
Remains in endoplasmic reticulum and remains cell associated
Inhibit apoptosis and interferon
Transmitted primarily in blood and by sex
Coinfection with HIV-1
### Outcomes of HCV
Acute hepatitis with resolution and recovery in 15%
Chronic infection in 70%
Initial infection may be asymptomatic
Can lead to chronic active hepatitis within 10-15 years
### HCV and HCC
HCC risk increases with longer times after primary infection
### Transmission
No vaccine
Treat initially with IFNa or with Ribavirin
Ribavirin: Nucleoside analogue inhibit nucleoside biosynthes, mRNA capping, and RNA pol
## Hepatitis E
**Enteric Virus**
Oral-fecal
HEV is linear, ssRNA+
Sympotoms similar to HAV, but higher mortalitty rate
Does not establish chronic infection, self limiting.
## Hepatitis G = HGV = GB Virus C = GBV-C
Same virus, two different names
Non-A, Non-B hepatitis
Failed to identify any association between virus and any clinical illness
GBV-C related to HCV, but replicates in **lymphocyte** instead of **hepatocytes**
GBV belong to fourth genus within Flaviviridae named **Pegivirus**
Blood, sex.
HepC pT show
