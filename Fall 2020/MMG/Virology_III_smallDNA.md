## Small/Medium DNA viruses
### Polyoma, Papilloma, Adeno
#### Adeno
Two genera, aviadenovirus and mastasdenovirus
Genome is ds Linear DNA 30-40kb long
5' terminal protein and DNA binding protein
Capsid icsosahedron with fiber attachment protein at each vertice
NON-Enveloped
Can utilize both strands for transcription. 
Makes a lot of dsRNA which also **induces a ton of IFN**

##### Replication
Enter cells via receptor mediated endocytosis
Early genes transcibed and translated useing host protein
- Activate more viral gene expression
- Induce host enter S phase
- Block apoptosis
- Inhibit IFN
- In permissive: early gene expression followed by viral DNA replication - using 5' terminal protein as primer
- DNA replication followed by expression of **late genes**
  - Structural proteins that get made in cytosol and then target back into nucleus
- High copy number leads to cell lysis
- Can establish latent or persistent infect in some cells.

47 serotype divided into 6 subgroups (A-F)
Cause respiratory disease, conjunctivitis, hemorrhagic cystitis, and gastroenteritis.
Differences due to penton base and fiber protein
Establish lytic infection in respiratory and GI tract. Latent in lymphoid tissue
Cause URI and croup
Immunocompromised leads to fulminant respiratory failure, hepatitis, death

Virus enter URT through eyes or upper resp. Goes LRT or GI then into lymph nodes. Skin or other ogans, and then resolves or persists.
One week incubateion and then contagious

Acute respiratory disease: 3,4,7,14
Hemorrhagic Cystitits: 11, 21


Treatment:
No specific anti-viral drugs, some broad specturm work for immunocompromised.
Vaccine made for military a while ago, but production stopped.


#####
#### Parvo
Smallest DNA virus
Non-enveloped icosahedral capsid 18-26nm
Genome is ssDNA, 5.5kb
Genus ertyhrovirus, species B19
Depndovirus, species adeno associated virus - species requries adenovirus present to infect
Only able to infect proliferating cells.
  - Dependednt on cellular enzymes, cannot induce quiescent cells into cell cycle


Genome:
Inverted repeats at the ends of genome
Partially uncoated, need to get viral dn into nucleus to make dsDNA
Make mRNA to make viral proteins
Single stranded dna can be + or -

Fifth classic childhood rash and can infect dogs

Primary replication in respiratory tract, then bone marrow -> kills replicating erythroid precursor cells
Virema
Complexes precipitate in skin and joints, causing rash
Rash on both cheeks, followed with erythematous rash on trunk nad limbs
No specific thrrapy or vaccine

Aplastic Crisis
Replicates in RBC precursors
PT with Chronic hemolytic anemia -> aplastic anema can occur
Virus can cross placenta and cause hydrops fetalis

#### Papilloma
Small, non-enveloped
dsCircular DNA
Depened on host cell polymerase to express their genes
100 serotypes
Some sexually transmitted
16 and 18 cause squamous cell carcinoma
Lytic replication in permissive cells
Can persist either integrated or unintegrated
Warts: Benign - Plantar/common - transmitted by direct contact
Laryngeal papillomatosis - benign tumors on larynx

Development of papilloma (warts)

HPV and cancer:
85% cervical carcinoma contain HPV dna
HPV genome is episomal (not integrated into the host genome) in cervical warts and pre-neoplastic lesions
Genome is integrated into genome of malignant cervical cancers
Can also cause cancer in vagina and vulva, penis, anus, and throat.

How does virus cause tumor?
E5 gene - activate epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor
E6 gene - Targets p53 suppressor for degrade
E7 gene - Inhibits pRb suppressor from halting cell cycle

**5 promotes growth, 6 and 7 prevent suppression**

Detection:
Papanicolaou stain (pap smear)
Detects perinuclear vacuolated cytoplasm, sign of cancer and of HPV
PCR

Prevention:
Gardasil for male and female
Gardasil protect against HPV 6,11,16,18 (cervical and anal cancer, cervical warts)
Gardasil 9 also protects against 31,33,45,52,58
16,18 cause 80% of cervical cancer
6,11 cause 90% genital warts
Cervarix only for female
Cervarix: protect only against 16,18

##### Polyomavirus
Small non-enveloped
Circular dsDNA
Two human viruses BK and JC
Don't usually cause disease in healhty people, but they can establish latent infection in kidneys
In immunocompromised the virus can reactivate and cause severe urinary tract infections (BK)
or Viremia and CNS infection with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML JC)
Inoculate into respiratory tract
replicate and cause primary viremia
Multiply in kidney
Secondary viremia, healthy people either resolve or go latent
Immunosuppressed see reactivation and then urinary tract if BK, CNS if JC

###### Merkel Cell Virus MCV
ds DNA, a polyoma virus
Infect older kids and adults
Integration of MCV genome is cause of rate but aggressive skin cancer
80% merkel cell carcinomas contain MCV genome
1500 caseas/year
High incidence in elderly
