## Arbovirus
Arthropod Borne Virus
Members of **Flavi, Toga**
- Yellow, and cloak 
Viral diseases shared by animals and or insects and humand are called zoonoses
- West Nile, Yellow fever, Dengue, etc
### Toga and Flavi
Enveloped RNA+
Encode early nonstructural and late structural
**Toga** replicate in cytoplasm and bud through **plasma membrane**
**Flavi** replicate in cyto and bud through **intracellular membranes**
### Arbovirus Life Cycle
Person-Person can occur, but uncommon
Blood transfusion, organ transplant can transmit arboviruses if present in donor
### Disease of Alpha and Flavi
Initial viremia can cause flu symptoms
- IFN cause this
- Secondary viremia may occur after replication in **monocytes/macrophages**
- **Immune response can block spread**, but **non-neutralizing AB can enhance uptake of flavi into mphage.**
Humans often dead-end hosts because they cannot maintain persistent viremia
Infectious cycle usually seasonal.
### Human Flavi Pathogens
Dengue, yellow, zika, etc
### Human ALpha(toga) Pathogen
Chikungunya, semliki forrest, sindibis, easter and western equine encephalitis
### Yellow Fever Life Cycle
Finlays mosquito hypothesis
Lytic or persistent infect
Female mosquitoes acquire virus during feeding on viremic host
Virus infects epithelial cells of mosquito and spread to circulation, then salivary gland. Released into saliva and transmitted to new vertebrate host
- Liver failure, Jaundice, hence 'Yellow' Fever
### Dengue Virus Patho
Known as break-bone fever- high fever, headache, rash, back/bone pain
4 strains
DHF - hemorrhagic fever
DSS - Dengue shock syndrome
No vaccine, supportive care only
### Dengue Life Cycle
1. Human inoculated with mosquito saliva
2. Virus localize and replicate in target organs, eg lymph nodes and live
3. Virus released and spreads through blood to infect WBC and lymphatic tissue
4. VIrus released and ciruclate in blood
5. Taken up by mosquito
6. Replicate in mosquito belly
7. Pass to mosquito saliva
8. Reinfect new host
## West Nile Virus
Encephalitis Antigenic *Complex*
Flu like symptoms and **enchephalitis**
### West Nile in Humans
Two forms
- WN Fever
- WN Neuroinvasive disease
WNN occurs rarely, causes encephalitis, meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis
### Treatment
No vaccine, supportive care
Testing IFNa, nucleoside, IV immunoglob
Vaccine for horses!
## Zika Virus
Mild/asymp in most people
During pregnancy causes microcephaly
In adults linked to Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS)
- Zika shown to infect schwann cells
No specific treatment or vaccine
Transmited by mosquitos, sex, blood
## Chikungunya
Fever, joint pain
Does not result in death, symptoms can be severe and disabling
Resolve within a week
## Rabies
Animals: Lethargy, uncoordinated, throat/jaw muscle paralysis, drooling
Neuorotropic virus - Travel up CNS to eyes, salivary glands, 
Virtually always fatal
Incubation: 2-12 weeks up to 2 years
Prodome phase ensues for 2-10 days
- fever, malaise, headache, pain
Neurologic symptoms appear:
- Hydrophobia
- Paralysis of swallowing muscles
- Focal and generalized seizures, disorientation
- Comatose - Almost universally leads to death
### Rabies Treatment
Treat the wound
Immediate immunization with vaccine combine with anti-rabies IgG
## Filovirus - Marburg and Ebola
Filamentous enveloped virion
RNA- genome
Cause severe hemorrhagic fevers
## EBolavirusa
EVD is rare and deadly
Ebola, Sudan, Tai FOrest, Bundibugyo virus are four that can infect humans
Transmission if through contact with infected animal. 
- This is called a spillover event.
- After this, spread person-person
## Filovirus Marburg and Ebola
Level 4 pathogen
Transmission: animal reservoir then human-human via direct contact blood
Replicates in monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells
- Cause cytokine storm
Incubatation 5-10 days
Flu like in begining, leads to hemorrhagic symptoms
Rash and maculopapular on trunk
2nd week - either resolves or multi-organ failure and death
### Treatment for Ebolaviruses
Fluid and electrolytes
Oxygen therapy
BP medication
**All supportive.**
## Poxviridae
Pox are any disease that has purulent skin eruptions that may leave pockmarks
Genus: Orthopoxviurs
**- Variola Virus: Smallpox**
Oval/brick shaped
Genome dsDNA linear, unique replication: **only DNA virus that replicates entirely in host cytoplasm**
Enveloped
## Pathogenesis
Highly contagious and strictly human.
Inhalation
Multiplication in upper respiratory tract
Spread to lymphatics, infection of macrophages
Spread to lymp nodes and rest of body
## Symptoms
Lesions in mucous membranes and on skin
## Variola Virus: clinical symptoms
Major: Rash, high fever 30% fatalitiy
Minor: less
## Treatment
Supportive
Live recombinant virus vaccine
- **with vaccinia not variola**
- Eradication in 1980
