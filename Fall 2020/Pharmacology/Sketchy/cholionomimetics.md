Parasympathetic port town.
Billboard with a mime drinking a coke that reads 'Enjoy Acetyl-Cola'. **Mimetic. Acetylcholine receptor agonists**
Smoker. **Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors**
Smoker is leaning against a telephone pole that has trasnformers and a wired going down to an outlet. **Nicotinic receptors being found on autonomic ganglia and skeletal muscle motor end plates**
Smoker wears a beanie. **Nicotinic receptors also found on Adrenal gland.**
Smoker is in front of a TV showing ION News. **Ion channels**

Three motorcycle parking spots labeled M1, M2, M3 all directly attached to the QIQ store. **Muscarinic receptor types are found on the effector organ**
QIQ sign over the motorcycles. **M1 - Gq, M2 - Gi, M3 - Gq**
M1 and M3 motorycle has a side care with three dogs. **IP3-DAG cascade**
M2 has a packed up camping tent. **Inhibits cAMP**
M1 cyclist ahs a brain helmet. **CNS, in the brain**
M2 cyclist has a torn leather jacket painted with the top of a heart. **M2 found on atria of heart. SA and AV nodes. No ventricular M2 receptors**
M3 is holding a glandular sponge. **M3 found on glands**
M3 has a nitric oxide exhaust. **Activation of M3 receptors causes NO release in vascular smooth muscle cells. NO increases cellular cGMP and vasodilation.**
Smaller exhaust on M3 is clogged. **Atherosclerosis causes vascular epithelial damage. In this case, M3 activation leads to vasoconstriction because we lose the NO ability.**

Beth the construction working drinking a cola. **Bethanechol is a cholinomimetic.**
Cement truck pouring cement from a colon shaped spout in front of Beth. **Bethanecol increases secretion and motor activity of the gut.**
Do not obstruct sign **Bethanechol is used to treat non-obstructive GI issues. They won't help with obstructed issues.**
Beth is watering cement with a hose. **Bethanechol can be used to treat urinary retention**

Pile of carp dumped on the dock dripping water. **Pilocarpine is a cholinomimetic that increases salivation.**
The net carrying the carps have little glass balls tied to it.  **Pilocarpine is used to treat glaucoma. It causes accommodation of the lens. It contracts ciliary muscle and increases aqueous outflow.** 
Fisherman near the pile of carps wearing a hoody. He cinches the hood shut around his face. **Constricted hood represents pilocarpine activating the sphincter pupillae muscle causing pupil constrcition (myosis)**

There is another dude living above the QIQ store with a cinched up hood. There is carbon fumes from the smoker reaching up to him. **Carbachol, which is both muscarininc and nicotinic agonist. It also has a pupillary constriction role.**

Para-city marathon challenge *Methacholine challenge used for asthma testing**
Dude running through the finish line drinking a coke. **Cholinomimetic**

Anoter dude at the race is wheezing for breath. **Cholinomimetics contract bronchia smooth muscles, which can exacerbate asthma or COPD**

Very-clean flyer on the telephone pole the smoke is on. **Varenicline for smoking cessation**
