Terrarirum in background with a frog in it sitting ontop of a mushroom. **Amphibian~amphotericin. Antifungal**
Sign above terrarium reads Non Sterol **Fungal cell membrane made of ergosterol, not cholesterol.**
The terrarrium is leaking water. **Amphotericin and nystatin bind ergosterol and form pores in the cell wall.**
Anatomical model next to the terarrium with its chest open exposing the organs. **Amphotericin treats severe systemic fungal infections**
    - Sever fungal pneumonia, cryptococcal, histo, coccidymyosis, etc.
There is ivy growing on top of the terrarium **Ampho is administered as IV**
  - There is a liposomal drug formation that lowers toxicity

Immediate Reactions:
Frog attacking one of the teacher's neckties with a cholesterol design. **Amphotericin will non-selectively bind to human cholesterol, causing toxicity**
The teacher is falling back and clutching his head. **Fainting, hypotension, headache**
Another frog nearby is shaking and on fire. **Shake and bake fever and chills**
Frog on terrarium slapping its tongue onto the anatomical model's brain. **Intrathecal administration to treat fungal CNS infections.**
Model's brain is vibrating **Seizures**
Blue veins on the frog licking the brain **thrombophlebitis**

Slow Reactions due to accumulation:
Teacher falling back and spilling a graduated cylinder with the number 1 on it of acid on himself. **Renal tubular acidosis Type 1**
He is falling back because he slipped on a bannana peel. **RTA1 is associated with hypokalemia (potassium)**
Varying degrees of anemia

Dude playing a flute **Flucytosine**
Frog hopping across a music stand that have the notes F and C, when the frog knocks the sheet music over the C looks like a U. **Cytosine deaminase converts flucytosine into 5-fluorouracil**
Bars of music on the chalkboard look like DNA helix, and a frog is falling down smearing it. **Flucytosine halts fungal DNA synthesis**
There is an opera called Anthony and Cleopatra, with a crypt drawn on the blackboard. **Flucytosine combined with Amphotericin often used to treat cryptococcal infections**

A sign that says Be NYCE. **Amphotericin and Nystatin have the same MoA.**
Candaians outside throwing snow on eachother's crotches. **Nystatin is useful for candida and is applied topically**
