Cabins A1 A2 B1 B2: The main receptor types for the sympathetics
Sail on raft with two kids chilling on it. QISS on the sail. **Describes which kind of g protein each receptor associated with.**
Alpha scouts
A1 cabin has a single lit candle. In front is a scout walking three dogs, one is holding a Ca2 bone - **A1 is Coupled to Gq. It is an IP3-DAG cascade. Increased intracellular Ca leads to smooth muscle activation**
The dogs are on thin red leashes **Alpha 1 activation increases peripheral arterial resistance (vasoconstriction in small arteries, arterioles, precapillary sphincters)**
Scout with dogs is holding a map with an arrow pointing up. **A1 agonist increase Mean Arterial Pressure**
Another scout walking three dogs on thin blue leashes. **A1 agonists increase venous return, meaning also venoconstriction**
Scout with binoculars. **Pupil dilation. Mydriasis**
Scout tugs his pants tight. **Contraction of sphincters in urinary tract. Urinary retention**

Cabin A2 has the word sympathy crossed out. **No sympathy because A2 agonists are sympatholytitcs, meaning the act centrally to decrease sympathetic tone and reducing blood pressure**
Cabin A2 has a broken down camping tent in front. **A2 are Gi proteins, which decrease cAMP levels when activated.**
A2 scout packing up presynaptic wire. **A2 activation causes inhibition of neurotransmitter release. Local, negative feedback**
Rolled up welcome inside math. **Insulin release decreased.**
A2 scout dousing fire roasting a pig. **A2 also decreases lipolysis**
A2 scout dousing the fire is pouring the water from an eyeball hat. **Activation of A2 at ciliary body decreases production of aqeuous humor. Brimonidine is an A2 agonist used to treat open angle glaucoma.**

Band Camp. There are set up camping tents in front of beta cabins. **Activation of Gs receptors causes increase of cAMP**
B1 cabin, counsellor blowing a bugle. Her shirt says I <3 band camp. **B1 activation causes increase cAMP which increases Ca2 and B1 are found mostly in the heart! Increase contractility and heart rate.**
She also holds a heart clock. **B1 increases heart rate, because of SA node**
She is also really buff. **Increase cardiac contractility because of cardiac myocyte activation**
Hear hydrant pumping water into the river **Increased cardiac output caused by B1**
Some kid wearing a yellow rain coat and a yellow umbrella **B1 activation increases renin release**

B2 cabin has a girl playing a tuba in front. **Dilated tuba refers to relxation of smooth muscle.**
Scout taking deep breath before playing tuba. **B2 activation leads to bronchodilation**
She has loose red sleeves. **B2 activation cuases coronary and skeletal muscle vasodilation. Decreases systemic vascular resistance.**
She wears dangling DIAmond earrings. **B2 activation decreases diastolic blood pressure**
Pig being roasted! **Activate lipolysis and release of free fatty acids.**
Girl roasting marshmellows taken from a liver shaped bag. **B2 activation promotes gluconeogenesis**
Girl bringing smores into the tent, welcome inside mat. **B2 activation promotes insulin release**
Banana peels on the ground **B2 activation cause hypokalemia **potassium driven into cells**
Camper fills eyeball balloons **B2 activation at ciliary body increases aqueous humor production**


Two guys in flannel shirts squirting in the nose and holding binoculars. **Phenylephrine, nasal decongestant, mydriasis, increase systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure as well as SVR.
Flannel guys have a dangling heart clock. **Reflex bradycardia**

Scout leader blowing a bugel with a really buff arm. He is on the camp A side of the river and holds a compass pointed north. **Norepinephrine is primarily a A1/A2 agonist with some B1 activity. Increase systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure. Reflex bradycarida counteracts. But the added B1 agonist maintains increased cardiac contractility. So overall, cardiac stroke volume is increased.**

Beta side of river girl wears Just DO BUgaling shirt. **Dobutamine. Prefer B1 more than B2.**
SHe carries a heart flashlight. **Dobutamine is gonna pump up all the heart effects.**
She has a freind with loose sleeves. **Since dobutamine has some B2 activity, there is a decrease in SVR. If we combine the effects of increased cardiac output and decreased SVR we see an increased Pulse Pressure, which is the difference between systolic and diastolic pressure.**
Batteries for the heart flash light have little lighning bolts on them **Dobutamine can be used for cardiogenic shock**

Two campers have a tunnel between two tents. B1 tent has heart clock. B2 girl has dangling earrings and loose sleeves. **Isoproternol is a b1/b2 agonist. Heart rate and contractility of B1 and vasodilation of B2, decreased diastolic pressure and SVR. Isoproternol will decrease Mean Arterial Pressure because there is arterial dilation and SVR decrease The B1 will maintain the systolic pressure though.**

'-rol' refer to **B2 agonists that have Bronchodilation effect so, abuterol, fomorterol, etc.**


Low doses of epinephrine lean toward Beta2 affects.
- Vasodilation, drop in SVR, increase in contractility,
