### Amphotericin B
For systemic infections: Amphotericin B PK
### Amphotericin B MoA
Bind to ergosterol (fungal cell wall) and form pores in membrane. Cell contents leak out, leading to cell death.
- Human membrane contains cholesterol, which is similar to egosterol, which leads to some toxicity in human treatment.
Resisitance: Ergosterol binding impaired by either decreasied membrane concentraition of ergosterol or modification of sterol target.
Lipid formulation Strategy: Use of lipid vehicle to minimize toxicity
### Broad Spectrum Activity
- Yeasts
- Mycoses
- Molds
- Mucormycosis
- **Resistance: Candida lusitaniae and pseudallescheria boydii**
### Amphotericin B Uses
- Reserved for life-threatening mycotic infections
- Often used as initial induction regimen to rapidly reduce fungal burden, and then is replaced by a newer azole antifungal for maintainance
- Induction Therapy important with severe fungal infections:
  - Severe cryptococcal meningitis, endemic mycoses such as histo or coccidymyosis
- Can be used for fungal infections of the eyes
- Fungal arthritis (e.g. candida, histo, blasto, crypto, aspergillus)
- Candiduria (fungal UTI) responds to bladder irrigation
  - No systemic toxicity since its bypassing bloodstream
### Amphotericin B Adverse Effects
Infusion-related reactions:
  - Fever chills muscle spasms vomiting headache hypotension
  - Premedication with antipyretics, antihistamines, meperidine or corticosteroids can be helpful
**Renal toxicity is the most significant adverse reaction:**
- Reverseible: ASsociated with decreased renal perfusion
- Irreversible: Injury to renal tubular system and manifests as renal tubular acidosis and severe potassium something.
Some abnormal liver function.
Varying degree of anemia.
Intrathecal therapy has chance to cause seizures and chemical arachnoiditis
## Flucytosine
Pyrimidine analog, related to 5-FU
Narrower spectrum than Amphotericin B
Poor protein binding, penetrate well into all body fluid including CSF.
Eliminated by glomerular filtration. 3-4hr half life.
Does not have much antifungal effect on its own, but is **synergistic** with amphotericin B
### Flucytosine Adverse Effects
LEvels rise rapidly with renal impairment and can lead to tocicity
Bone marrow toxicity with anemia
Leukopenia
Thrombocytopenia
## Azoles
MOA: Reduction of ergosterol synthesis by inhibition of fungal P450
  - Greater selectivity for fungal P450 than human.
Ketoconazole: Lesser degree of selectivity
  - **Higher incidence of drug interactions (due to inhibition of P450)**
Spectrum of action is broad
- Many species of candida, crypto
- Useful in treatment of intriniscally **amphotericin B resistant organisms**
    -  **Like boydii**
### Azole AE
Relatively non-toxic
- Most common AE is GI upset
Have been reported to cause abnormalities in liver enzymes
Prone to drug interactions because they inhibit P450
### Drugs
Ketoconazole
#### **Itraconazole:**
- Oral and IV
- Reduced bioavail when taken with **rifamycins - P450 Inducers**
- Drug of choice: Histoplasma, Blastomyces, SPorothrix, Aspergillus
  - Replaced by voriconazole as azole for aspergillus
AE: GI, hypokalemia, hypertension, edema
- Contraindicated in patients with CHF (dose dependent)
#### Fluconazole
- Water soluble good CSF penetration
- Unlike ketoconazole and itraconazole, oral bioavailability is high
- **Less common drug interactions**
- Fewer hepatic enzyme interactions
- Widest therapeutic index of the azoles -> permits more aggressive dosing
- *Azole of choice in treatment and prophylaxis of cryptococcal meningitis*
- Most commonly used for mucocutaneous candidiasis
Prohylaxis: Reduces fungal disease in bone marrow transplant recipients and aids patients, but there has been an amergence of resistance
AE: GI and rash. More severe toxicity is unusual but includes: heaptic necrosis, stevens johonson syndrome, anaphylaxis, alopecia
#### Voriconazole
IV and ORal
Well absorbed orally, BA 90%
Less protein binding than itraconazole
Metabolism predominantly hepatic
Inhibitor of mammalian CYP3A4 so many medications will require dose reduction
- Cyclosporine, tacrolimus, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors
AE: Rash, elevated hepatic enzymes, visual disturbances, photosensitivity dermatitis
Activity: Candida sp and dimorphic fungi (histo capsulatum)
- Treatment of choice for invasive aspergillosis
- Measurement may predict toxicity and clinical efficacy
- TI should be between 1 and 5 mcg/ml
#### Posaconazole
NEW!!!!
Delayed release tablets and oral suspension
**Absorption is improved when taken with high fat meals**
Rapid distribution to tissue, result in **high tissue levels and relatively low blood level**
Two drug interactions:
  - *Tacrolimus and Cyclosporin* -> Increased plasma concentration of these immunosuppressant drugs
Broadest spectrum. Activity against most **Candida and Aspergillus**
**Significant activity against mucormycosis** (rare fungal infection by mold)
Licensed for: Salvage therapy in invasive aspergillosis
Prophylaxis of fungal infections during induction chemo for leukemia
Allogneic bone marrow transplant patients with graft-host disease


#### Echinocandins
Active against Candida and Aspergillus
Limitation: Not active against c. neoformas or the mucormycosis
Only available as IV
Caspofungin: half life: 9-11 hours
- USed against invasive aspergillosis
  Micafungin longer half life 11-15 hour
  - Used on candidemia
  Anidulafungin half life 24-48 hr
  - For esophageal candidiasis
MOA: Level of fungal cell wall by inhibiting synthesis of B(1-3)-glucan. Result in disruption of cell wall and death
Well tolerated, minor GI side effect and flushig. No drug interactions.

#### Terbinafine
Liphphilic and accumulates in skin nails and fatty tissue
Treat dermatophytoses
Fungicidal - interfere with ergosterol
MOA: Inhibit fungal enzyme squalene epoxidase - lead to accumulation of sterol squalene, which is toxic


#### Nystatin
Only used topically
Little tocivcity
#### Azoles
OFten used for vulvovaginal candidiasis
#### Allylamines
Terbinafine and naftifine
Topicals
