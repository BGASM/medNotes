## Targeted Therapies
Targeted Therapies attack specific molecular targets.
- Very effective if specific target is driving cancer-
- Less toxic that traditional-
- Generally not curative as single agents-
Traditional vs Targeted:
- Reduce mortality
- Stop disease progression
- More toxic
## Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors and Monoclonal Antibodies
### TKIs "nibs" - Imatinib, Dasatinib, Nilotinib
- Imatinib used for CML. Inhibit proliferation of bcr-abl fusion prot.
  - **Binds to ATP binding pocket of Tyr kinase**
- TKI's are part of normal cellular pathways
- Inhbition of TKI can cause **off-target** effects:
  - MoA has unintended organ insults
  - Myelosuppression
### Monoclonal Antibodies - Trastuzumab
- MAB that targets Her2/neu receptor.
  **- HER2/neu is also expressed in cardiomyocytes** - which explains **off-target cardiotoxicity**  
## Hormone Receptor Modulators
### Estrogen and Breast Cancer
Estrogen fuels growth of breast cancer cells
- Inhibitors:
  - Pre menopause: Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators **SERMs** - **Tamoxifen**
  - Post menopause: **Aromatase Inhibitors** - **Exemestane**
  - Average age of menoupause is 51 yrs.
#### SERM - Tamoxifen
75% of breast cancer epxpress estrogen receptors *ER+*, 65% express progesterone receptors *PR+*
- Tamoxifen for hormonal therapy:
    - Prodrug. **Hydroxymetabolites** provide the anti-tumor activity.
    - Partial estrogen agonist
    - Antagonist in breast tissue
    - Can prevent breast cancer in high risk PT and treat those with advanced or localized disease
    - **Adverse**: Due to estrogenic effects - Uterine Cancer
#### Aromatase Inhibitors
```Exemestane, Letrozole, Anastrozole â€“ Inhibit the enzyme aromatase ONLY in peripheral tissue (NOT in ovaries) so only useful in post-menopausal women```
## Epigenetic Modifiers
### Hypomethylating Agents Azacitidine and Decitabine
- **Inhibit DNA methyltransferases**
  - Hypomethylation
  - Apoptosis
  - Reverse epigenetic silencing
- Need to be incorporated into DNA through reduced metabolite
    - One cycle of replication gets hemimethylated. Two cycles for entire demthylation.
    - **Several doses** are needed for clinical response.
  - At high doses it acts like anti-pyrimidine (*cytotoxic and anti-metabolite*)
### Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors - Vorinostat, romidepsin, belinostat, panobinostat
- HDAC catalyzes **removal of acetyl groups** from histones.
  - DNA wraps more tightle when acetyl groups are removed. Silenced, euchromatin.
  - This prevents the expression of **tumor suppressor genes**
- HDAC inhibitors bind to the enzyme and prevent it.
- Increased acetylation of DNA, and **expression of the silenced genes**
- **Adverse Effects**:
  - Cardiac Toxicity
  - GI Tox
  - Mild myelosuppression
----------------------------------------------------
## Immunomodulatory Drugs
### Immuno Blockade Therapy
```
T cell activation requires two signals: TCR and B7/CD28 co-stim. 
In normal situations, T cell de-activate themselves by binding their CTLA4 receptor to CD80 on DCs. 
PD1 pathway delivers inhibitory signals to immune system to slow down. Limits initiation and duration of immune response. When a T cell activates it induces PD1 expression.
Production if IFNg also upregulates PD1L, which binds to PD1 and turns it off.
Tumor cells evade by either upregulating the PD1L or by upregulating CD80 and binding T cell CTLA4, downregulating them, or by hiding CD28.
```
- Anti-CTLA4: Ipilimumbab
- Anti-PD1: Pembrolizumab, Nivolumab
- Anti-PD1L: Atezolizumab, Avelumab, Durvalumab
#### CTLA-4:
- Receptors are distributed through secondary lymphoid organs
- Target recently primed T cells
- Phosphatases SHP1,2, PP2a
- Inhibit glycolysis
#### PD1
- Inflamed peripheral tissue and secondary lymphoid organs
- Target Effector T cells
- Phosphatase SHP2
- Inhibit Glycolysis and induce Fatty Acid Oxidation
#### Side Effects of checkpoint inhibitors
- They can cause autoimmune side effects
    - MAB's are highly specific, so not an issue of off-target toxicities
    - **Substantial on-target toxiciites possible**
  - Pembrolizumab therapy caused thyroiditis and thyroid dysfunction
    - Majority of cases result in irreversible hypothyroidism
    - Similar issues of thyroid dysfunction observed in melanoma
â€“ Other immune related adverse events can occur with systemic administration of immune checkpoint inhibitors 
    - dermatologic, gastrointestinal, hepatic, endocrine inflammatory events 
    - temporary immunosuppression with corticosteroids, TNFÎ± antagonists, or other agents effective in most cases but can be fatal
    - Dermatitis, Colitis, Hepatitis
- Side Effects of CAR T therapy:
  - Cytokine Release Syndrome
    - When the CAR T cell engages surrogate antigens it releases a variety of cytokines that get picked up by macrophages and other innate immune cells.
    - They go nuts for it and start shitting the bed too.
    - CAR T cells are able to get into CSF, and it is possible that their cytokine release would make the BBB permeable to more CAR T cells and other immune cells.
  - Neurotoxicity, Hemodynamic instability (tachycardia, hypotension, capillary leak) Organ Dysfunction (AST and ALT elevation, Hyperbilirubinemia, Respiratory Failure)
## Miscellaneous
### L-Asparaginase
- **L-Asparaginase is specific for G1 phase**

- **Must be adminstered within 9-10 days before OR 24 hours after treatment with antifolate methotrexate**
  - Concurrent asparginase use can block methotrexate (S phase) activity by inhibitin cell replication and inhibiting glutaminatinase *which methotrexate requires for optimal accumulation*
    - Aspariginase before methotrexate is **ANTAGONISTIC**
    - Methotrexate before asparaginase may be **SYNERGYSTIC**
