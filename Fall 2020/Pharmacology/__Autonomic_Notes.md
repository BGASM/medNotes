Cholinergic Responses:
Muscarinic:
M1, M3: Gq, and generally activating.
M1-> Brain: Secrete more stuff, arousal, emotions, etc.
M3-> Smooth muscles and glands: Contract smooth muscles and secrete glandular stuff.

M2: Gi, generally inhibitory
M2 -> Atria of the heart. Slow heart rate.
M4 -> CNS affects K and Ca ion channels

Adrenergic:
A1  -> Vascular smooth muscle: Contract
    -> Pupil dilator Myadriasis
    -> Prostate contract 
     
A2  -> Adrenergic and Cholinergic nerve terminals, inhibit Nt release
    -> Vascular smooth muscle CONTRACT
    -> Fat cells, inhibit lipolysis
    -> Inhinbit insulin release

B1  -> Increase Heart Rate, Contractility, Conduction
    -> Make kidney release Renin

B2  -> Vasodilation
    -> Bronchodilate
    -> Glycogenolysis
    -> Glucagon release
