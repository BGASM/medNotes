## Treatment Modalities
1. Primary induction: Only treatment. Used for cases where no alternative. Palliative.
2. Neoadjuvant: Reduce tumor size before surgery.
3. Adjuvant: Remove whatever tumor remains after surgery.

## Combination Therapy
1. Drug should be active if solo
2. Drugs should have different mechanism
3. Minimal cross-resisitance
4. Different toxic effects.

## Rescue
MESNA traps acrolein released by cyclophosphamide, reducing incidence of hemorrhagic cystitis.
Leucovorin is a tetrahydrofolate that gets accumulated by normal cells more than by neoplastic cells. Given with methotrexate to rescue normal cells from the effect of methotrexate.
