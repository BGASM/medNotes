## HSV and VZV
### Acyclovir
An acyclic guanosine derivative with no sugar moiety
Activity: HSV1/2, VZV
- 10x more potent against HSV than VZV
Weak against: Epstein Barr, cytomegalovirus, and human herpes virus 6 (EBV, CMV, HHV-6)
MOA: Three phosphorylation steps for activation
1. Converted first into **monophosphate** derivative by the **virus specified thymidine kinase**
2. Then to di- and triphosphate compounds by host cell enzymes
3. Because it requires viral kinase for initial phophorylation, **acyclovir is selectively activated** and the active metabolite only accumulates in infected cells.
It then inhibits viral DNA synthesis
Very poor BA. 15-20%
Cleared by renal
Half life 2.5-3 hr
20 hr in pt with anuria
Widely distributed to body fluid and tissue
CSF is 50% concentration 
Oral version shortens duration of symptoms by 2 days
Long term suppression with frequent recurrences of genital herpes
 - Decreases rate of sexual transmission and symptomatic recurrence
Prophylactic for PT organ transplant
IV choice for herpes simplex encephalitis or neonatal HSV
Topical Cream: less effective than oral for primary HSV.
Resistance can develop in HSV or VZV through alteration in viral thymidine kinase
AE: Nausea, diarrhea, headache.
Reversible renal toxicity
Neuro: Tremors, delirium, seizures
Use concurrent to nephrotoxic agents may enhance nephrotoxicicty
Probenecid and Cimetidine decrease clearance and increase exposure
### Valcyclovir
L-valyl ester of acyclovir (prodrug)
Has much higher absorption than acyclovir 55% vs 15-30%
Rapidly converted to acyclovir after oral administration via first pass enzymatic hydrolysis in liver
AE: Half life 2.5-3.3 hr
Once daily dosing
Nausea, headache, vomiting, rash
High dose: Confusion, hallucination, seizures
GI, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic-uremic syndrome
### Famciclovir
Diacetyl ester prodrug of 6-deoxypenciclovir - acyclic guanosine analog
Rapididly deacetylated and oxidized by first pass into penciclovir
Active: HSV 1/2, VZV, EBV, HBV
Same activation by multistep phosphorylation using virus thymidine kinase
- ALSO competitive inhibition of viral DNA polymerase
Cross resistance: HSV are cross resistant to acyclovir
BA of peniciclovir from orally taken famcicloviris 70%
HL 7-20hr
Excreted in urin
## CMV
CMV infections primarily in setting of advance immunosuprression and due to reactivation of latent infection
Leads to end-organ disease: retinitis, colitis, esophagitis, etc
### Drugs for end-organ CMV disease
Ganciclovir - **replaced with valganciclovir in US**
Foscarnet
Cidofovir
### Ganciclovir
Acyclic guanosine analog
Require activation by triphosphorylation
- Virus-specified protein kinase phosphotransferase **UL97**
- Poor BA.
- Gel for acute herpetic keratitits
### Valganciclovir
Well absorbed 60% BA
Renal elim
Activity: CMV
AE: Black tarry stool, blood in urine, blurred vision, lower back or side pain, painful or difficult urination, trembling/shaking
### Foscarnet
Pyrophosphate analog which blocks binding site of polymerase
IV only
Mean plasma HL is 3-7 hours
Renal excretion
30% of drug will deposit in bone, with HL of several months
Activity: CMV including ganciclovir-resistant. Also acyclovir-resistant HSV and VZV
*Dosage must be titrated according to PT calculated creatinine clearance (because it is ALL renal excretion)*
Majore AE:
Renal impariment, electrolyte and mineral
Saline preloading helps prevent nephrotoxicity
Avoid concomitant administration of drugs with nephrotoxic potential ( amphotericin B, pentamidine, aminoglycosides)
**Severe hypocalcemia** can result in dysrhythmias, phosphorus should be measured frequently
Risk of severe hypocalcemis: due to chelation of divalent cations
Genital ulcerations may be due to high levels of ionized drug in ruine
ANemia, elevation of liver enzymes
### Cidofovir
Cytosine analog. Already starts with a phosphate, so first step ins becoming a diphosphate. Starts working as diphosphate, not triphosphate
Activity: CMV, HSV1/2, VZV, EBV, HHV6, HHV8
**Independent of viral enzymes**
- THus it is still active against thymidine kinase def, or mutants that resist the other drugs.
Poor CSF pen
Renal elimination
IV is effective for CMV retinitis - must be admin with probenecid which blocks renal excretion and decreases nephrotoxicity
Calculate creatinine clearance before infusion
AE: Dose dependent nephrotoxicity
## Antiretroviral
### Seven Classes
1.  Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) 
2.  Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) 
3.  Nucleotide RT inhibitors 
4.  Protease inhibitors (PIs) 
5.  Fusion inhibitors 
6.  CCR5 co-receptor antagonists (also called entry inhibitors) 
7.  HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) 
-  These agents inhibit HIV replication at different parts of the cycle. 
### NRTI
Considered backbone of antiretroviral therapy
Generally used in combination with other classes, such as NNRTI, PI, or II
NRTIs are usually given in pairs
AE: Mitochondrial toxicity, likely due to inhibition of mitochondrial DNA pol gamma
Lactic acidosis with hepatic steatosis - which can be fatal
NRTI treatment should be suspended in the setting of:
- Rapidly rising aminotransferase levels, progressive hepatomegaly, or metabolic acidosis
Thymidine analogs *zidovudine and stavudine* may be associated with *dyslipidemia and insulin resistance*
#### Abacavir: 
- **Hypersensitivity Reactions** in 8% of pT. Occasionally fatal
- 50% rash
- Cough
- Screenings for HLAB5701 before treating with abacavir.
#### Tenofovir:
Acyclic nucleoside phosphonate, adenosine analog
Competitively inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase and causes chain termination
- Only two, rather than three, intracellular phosphorylations are required for activation
- Can bne used for HBV
- AE:
- GI complaints (eg, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, flatulence) are the most common adverse effects but rarely require discontinuation of therapy. 
- Since tenofovir is formulated with lactose, these may occur more frequently in patients with lactose intolerance. 
### Protease Inhibitors
Late stage HIV life cycle: gag and gag-pol gene products translated into polyproteins
PI's prevent post-translational cleavage of Gag-Pol
- **Prevents processing of viral proteins into functional forms**
AE:
- Mild-moderate nausea, diarrhea, dyslipidemia
- Redistribution and accumulation of body fat that results in
    - Central obesity 
    - Dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump) 
    - Peripheral and facial wasting 
    - Breast enlargement 
### Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitors INSTIs
Binds integrase and interferes with integration of reverse transcribed HIV DNA into chromosome of host cells
AE: Headache, GI
CNS
