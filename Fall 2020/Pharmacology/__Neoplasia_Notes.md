7. Which of the following statements is CORRECT regarding chemical carcinogenesis?
   - A. Carcinogens exert their tumorogenic effect by inducing lethal DNA damage in cells.
   - B. Most carcinogens are “direct” carcinogens, and do not require metabolic activation to exert their harmful effects.

   - D. Abnormalities in detoxifying enzymes are required to “permit” carcinogens to exert their tumorogenic effects.
   - E. The tumorogenic effects of promoters are both dose- and time- dependent.
```
Initiation: Irreversible, due to exposure, not enough for tumors.
Mutation: Occur in initiated cells. Rapid, irreversible.
Promotion: Non-mutagenic, lead to proliferationa of initiated cells. Reversible.
Chemical Carinogen Initiators can be direct or indirect. They are non-enzymatic,
they react via electrophilic or nucleophilic methods.
Direct: Alkylating agents, cancer drugs, acylating agents.
Indirect: Benzos, aromatics, plants and microbes, aflatoxin B1

Promoters: Alcohol, cigarettes, virus, diet, drugs, hormones, bile

   - C. Promoters lead to cellular instability, making a cell’s DNA susceptible to mutation.
   - D. The length of time between exposure to a promoter and an initiator is irrelevant since the change induced by an initiator is permanent.
```
- A. Incorrect because promoters do not lead to transformation, they only lead to proliferation.
- B. Correct. This is the definition.
- C. Promoters do not lead to cellular instability. Cellular instability is is a
hallmark of the error-prone NER DNA repair seen in response to UV rays and genomic
changes made by viruses.
- D. This is false. Time and Dose are definitive for promoters.

Bening tumors only expand locally, they do not invade.
C. Prominent nucleoli is evidence that a mass may be malignant, but it is not the
strongest evidnce.
D. Necrosis and hemorrhage are also evidence of malignancy, but not the strongest.
E. Pleomorphism is a mark of anaplasia, which is evidence of malignancy, but again
not all malignant tumors will display anaplasticity.

12. A 23-year-old woman undergoes a routine physical exam, and is found to be healthy. A Pap smear is obtained as part of the pelvic examination, and cytological examination of the smear reveals epithelial dysplasia. Which of the following statements is the MOST ACCURATE interpretation of this finding?
- **A. The lesion could progress to cervical carcinoma.**
- B. This is an insignificant lesion which should regress on its own.
- C. The lesion indicates regression of a cervical carcinoma.
- D. The lesion indicates a familial inheritance of a benign condition.
```
A. Correct. This would be considered an acquired predisposing factor. Along with
Chronic inflammation or immunodeficiency.
B. What? No.
C. No info on regression patterns, but dysplasia would be evidence that a malignancy
could happen in the future, not the other way around.
D. I have nothing in the coursepack that would even slightly suggest this.
```
13. Which of following is TRUE regarding methylation in tumor cells?
- A. The level of DNA methylation is generally higher in tumor cells than their normal-cell counterparts.
- **B. DNA methylation on the promoters of genes can alter transcription of genes without changing the gene’s DNA sequence.**
- C. The promoter regions of proto-oncogenes are often hypermethylated in tumor cells.
- D. DNA de-methylating drugs in low doses strongly increase the growth of tumors.
```
A. The opposite of this. Cancers cells typically exhibit hypomethyllation compared
to normal DNA counterparts, which leads to chromosomal instability, reactivation
of transporable elements, and imprinting losses. 
B. This is correct because this is literally just a definition of methylation.
C. Not seen for oncogenes, seen in tumor-suppressor genes. Hypermethylation
of the promoter regions of tumor-suppressor genes isa  major event in origin of
many cancers.
D. Opposite. DNA demthylating drugs in low doses can treat tumors.
```

14. Which of the following factors influences the STAGING of cancer?0
- A. degree of cell differentiation on histopathologic examination
- B. detection of cellular aneuploidy via flow cytometry
- C. number of mitoses per high-power microscopic field
- **D. presence of metastasis to local lymph nodes**
```
A & C Both describe factors that influence the GRADING of cancer. Grading is based
on the degree of differentiation and may take into account the number of mitoses or
architectural features. I-IV: Well-differentiated-Anaplastic.
B. Aneuploidy does not effect staging. Also, I don't think flow cytometry would be
best for determining aneuploidy - it is used for surface markers.
D. Correct! Staging is determined by surgery or imaging. Follows a TNM system:
T: Tumor 1-4, based on size, depth, extent of invasion.
N: Node 1-3, based on number and location
M: Metastases 0|1, based on whether or not we see metastases
```

15. Paraneoplastic syndromes can occur in the context of different malignancies. Which of the following statements is TRUE?
- A. Distant metastasis is thought to be responsible for the development of a paraneoplastic syndrome.
- **B. Hypercalcemia which develops as a result of bone metastasis and lysis is not considered a paraneoplastic syndrome.**
- C. Paraneoplastic syndromes typically occur as late manifestations of the associated malignancy.
- D. The presence of a paraneoplastic syndrome causes the malignancy to be staged one level worse than it would be otherwise.
```
A. Incorrect. Part of the definition of paraneoplastic syndrome is that it consists
of symptom complexes not explained by local effect OR distant spread of the tumor.
B. Correct. Hypercalcemia from bone metastasis and lysis would be considered a local effect.
C. Incorrect. Paraneoplastic Syndromes may represent the EARLIEST manifestation of a
malignant neoplasia.
D. Incorrect. Part of the definition is that paraneoplastic syndromes do not affect
the stage or treatment outcome.

Note. A paraneoplastic syndrome MAY represent significant clinical problems.

tumor population actually have capcity to initiate and sustain the tumor growth.
B. Correct, see A
C. Incorrect. Stem Cell Model dictates that cancer stem cell needs to have two qualities:
Self-renewal and differentiation.
D. Incorrect. Cancer stem cells can originate from transformation of a normal stem cell,
a progenitor, or a fully differentiated cell.
