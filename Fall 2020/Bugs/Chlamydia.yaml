Chlamydia Trachomatis:
    General:
                                - Gram negative rods. 
                                - Obligate intracellular parasite.
                                - Metabolically inactive, infectious form EB.
                                - Metabolically avtive, non-infectious form RB.
                                - Serovars associated with different diseases.
                                - STI
                                - Direct contact/congenital
    Disease:
                                - Trachoma A, B Ba, C:
                                    - Conjunctivitis, eye inflammation
                                    - Repeat infection can lead to blindness
                                    - Greatest cause of blindness worldwide.
                                - Urogenital D, K:
                                    - Uncomplicated infection that remains in urinary tract
                                    - Purulent exudent
                                    - Women often asymptomatic carriage
                                - LGV Lymphogranuloma L:
                                    - Can spread to lymph nodes and become systemic
                                    - Genital lesions
    Pathogenesis:
                                - Adhere - Invade - Transition - Exit:
                                    - Infect non-ciliated mucosal epithelial cells and monocytes
                                    - Attach to susceptible cell, induce phagocytosis
                                    - Reorganization into RB inside cell, then multiplication
                                    - Reorganization into EB and extrusion by reverse endocytosis
                                - Adhere:
                                    - Translocated Actin Recruiting Protein (TARP) (TIII sec.) makes a protein that gets injected into host cell. Host cell then puts this protein onto its own plasma membrane and then pathogen uses it as a binding receptor.
                                    - Binds to host receptors: heparin sulfate, estrogenR, etc.
                                - Invade:
                                    - Endocytosis, Pinocytosis, Phagocytosis
                                    - Triggering' mechanism like Shigella, but no ruffling
                                - Transition:
                                    - Gene expression, uses ATP stored in EB and diverts endsome from endocytic to exocytic
                                    - Prevent fusion with lysosome, Ag never gets processed so no Ab generated.
                                    - Steals sphyngomyelin from golgi for its own use.
                                    - Modify host fatty acids to look like prokaryote fatty acids
                                    - Signal cytoskeletal rearrangements to bring vacuole near nucleus.
                                    - RB-specific proteins IncA-G get phosphorylated by host and lead to vacuole fusion between bacterial vacules.
                                    - Growing RB chill by peripher, steal nutrients, grow.
                                    - Newly formed EB migrate to center of inclusion, and stop metabolizing.
                                - Exit:
                                    - Vacuolar membrane can break, releasing EB into cytoplasm OR
                                    - Vacuole fuses with host membrane, EB get released into extracellular space.
                                    - Either way, they spread to new cells.
    Labs:
                                - Epithelial scrapings needed
                                - No gram stain because the bacteria are too small
                                - Have to grow them in culture first
    Treatment:
                                - Doxycycline
                                - Fluoroquinolones
