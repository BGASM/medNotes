# Edema
-  60% bodyweight is water, 2/3 which is intracellular.
   - Of the remaining water, 35% is in extracellular space. AKA interstitial fluid and 'third spaces'
        - Third space is not quite interstitial, its like the cavities of the pleual or abdominal cavities, the pericardial sac. And fluid does collect in these spaces.
 - There is a balance of vascular hydrostatic pressure against plasma colloid osmotic pressure.
    - Hydrostatic is always a little higher, because fluid needs to escape the vessel and reach lymphatics.
    - While RBCs die, we will also keep fluid moving overall.  

 Transudate
  - Protein and cell poor edema that is caused by an increase in hydrostatic pressure, or a reduction in plasma proteins.  
  - It is common in organ failure and malnutrition.  
  - Appears clear or amber.  



 Exudate
  - Protein and cell rich edema that is caused by inflammation.  
  - It is one of the outcomes caused by the cascade of inflammatory-induced events (vascular permeability, cellular response.)  
  - Fluid appears amber or cloudy.


## Edema Names:
------------------------
 - Anasarca: Whole-body generalized and severe edema with subcutaneous tissue swelling.  
 - Serous: A transudate or light exudate with mainly edema fluid.  
 - Serosanguinous: Effusion with RBC.  
 - Fibrinous: Fibrin strans that bridge from heart and pericardial sac and are derived from a protein rich exudate.  
 - Purulent: Exudate with numerous neutrophils. ALso called empyema in pleural space.  

## Severity:
---------------------
- Edema can range from having minimal to life threatening consequences.
- Subcutaneous can be a bite or a blister, or it can signal systemic cardiac or renal disease.
- Localized edema can inhibit wound healing, prevent clearing pathogens, or cause a physical obstruction.
- Pulmonary edema can be caused by several clinical scenarious, and it can be life threatening.
- Cerebral edema can also be fatal, as it developes rapidly and can cause the brain to herniate.

## Morphology:
-----------------------
- Pitting Edema:
  - Subcutaneous:
    - Appears swollen, shiny and boggy
    - Compression artifact that resolves slowly.
    - Gravity and hydrostatic pressure cause **dependent edema** in the legs when standing or sacrum with prone.
    - Linked with Right heart failure
      - Poor blood return. Blood backs up into vena cava and edema builds up in lowed extremities.
  - **Pulmonary Edema**:
    - Heavy wet lungs.
    - **Frothy**, blood-tinged fluid expressed when compressing parenchyma.
  - Cerebral:
    - Generalized or local swelling.
    - Expanded gyri, narrowed sulci
    - Herniation of brain or brainstem
  
## Pathophysiology of Non-Inflammatory Edema:
-----------------------------
```
 Remeber that inflammatory edema makes sense. 
 Inflammation leads to vascular permeability/dilation.
 This hyperemia allows fluid to leave vessels and settle, causing edema.
```
1. Increased hydrostatic pressure **Usually Cardiac**
    - Can occur due as regional or systemic.
    - Localized edema in one leg can lead to **DVT** which can cause a focal impairment of venous return.
    - Generalized **increases in venous pressure can also lead to systemic edema**. Such as in congestive heart failure.
2. Reduced oncotic pressure due to inadequate plasma protein (albumin) **Usually Hepatic**
    - Reduced albumin synthesis (**liver disease**), malnut
3. Primary sodium retention. **Kidneys**
4. Primary water retention
5. Lymphatic obstruction leading to lymphedema.
    - Usually localized.
    - Lymphedema in an extremity, usually upper arm, is seen commonly due to removal of or radiation to axiallary lymph nodes. **Breast Cancer**
    - Parasitic disease **filariasis** show extensive lower limb and genital edema.

# Congestion and Hyperemia:

- Occur when a vascular space is expanded.
- Both result from **locally increased blood volume**.
- Associated with increased intravascular pressures, which often lead to edema.
- **Hyperemia** is an active process. It is due to blood inflow from arterial dilation.
  - Tissue becomes red and engorged with blood. **Obvious when seen**
  - Seen in skeletal muscle when exercising, or sites of inflammation.
- **Congestion** is a passive proocess due to impaired outflow of blood from tissue.
  - Tissue are blue **cyanotic**  due to accumulation of deoxyhemoglobin.
  - Over time, lack of oxygenated blood lead to localized hypoxia - which can eventually lead to ischemia and necrosis.
  - Capillaries rupture. Lead to characterisitc **hemosiderin-laden macrophages**
  - Organ Specific Congestion has characteristic morphologic changes:
    - Chronic pulmonary congestion:
      - Alveolara septa get thick and fibrotic.
      - Lots of the hemosiderin-laden macrophages (**heart failure cells**)
    - Chronic hepatic congestion:
      - Homorrhage within the lobes of the liver lead to a dumping-out of the hemosiderin-laden macrophages and hepatocytes.
      - These cells undergo ischemia and necrosis and they make the liver look mottled, red-brown, and depressed.
        - **Nutmeg Liver**
# Hemostasis

- Sequence of Events:
  1. Following injury **vasoconstriction** limits blood flow in the area. Vasoconstriction is transient and augmented by endothelial cell endothelin.
  2. Exposed **extracellular matrix is thrombogenic**. Induces reaction that causes **adherence and activateion of platelets** in order to form a **hemostatic plug**.
  3. Endothelial cells release tissue factor (**factor III or thromboplastin**) which works iwht factor VII to initiate **coagulation**. Thrombin gets generated at the site and cleaves **fibrinogen into fibrin**. Forms a fibrin mesh and this is secondary hemostasis.
  4. Fibrin and platelet aggregates form a stable plug. Counter processes to stop and revers thrombus formation.  
   
### Bleeding or Hypercoagulable state:
--------------------
 - **Bleeding State is inability to properly cause coagulation**
 - Bernard-Soulier Syndrome GP1B.
 - Von Willibrand disease due to too little or too weak vWF.
 - Glanzmaan thromoasthenia due to deficiency in GpIIa-IIIb.  
  
### Platlet vs Coagulation Cascade: Qualitative vs Quantitative**
------------------------
  - Platelet Tests:
    - Qualitative: Bleed time
    - Quantitative: Platelets are measured and counted.
  - Coagulation Tests:
    - Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time - aPPT
    - Prothrombin Time - PT.  
  -------
  
- Normal endothelium supports a state of anti-coagulation. If there is an injury we flip things up.
  - von WIllibrong Factor (GP1B receptor - deficiency is called Bernard-Soulier syndrome)
  - Tissue factor: Ectivates extrinsic pathway in response to TNF.
  - Plasminogen activator inhibitors: Favor thrombosis
