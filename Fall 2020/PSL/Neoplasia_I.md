## Neoplasia I
Classic:
- Neoplasm is abnormal mass which has a growth rate exceeding normal surrounding tissue. It persists after whatever stimuli evoked it.
Modern:
- Cancer is a cell growth disorder tigerred by series of acquired mutations that affects one cell and its progeny.
- Causative mutation give it survical edge that is independent of physiologic growth signals.

Tumors are composed of 2 components:
- Parenchyma
- Supportive stroma

Mixed Tumor- Cells of divergent differentiation, but still from the same single germ layer.

Teratoma- Cells from more than one germ layer

Hamartoma - Aberrant or disorganized BENIGN mass that contains mature cells that belong in the area.

Choristoma - Heterotpic crest of cells in an unrelated organ

Characteristics Of Tumor
Differentiation and ANaplasia
- Anaplasia = Lack of differentiation
- Benign tumors are usually well-differentiated
  - Look like the correct cell, just way too many of them.
- Malignant Tumors range from well-differentiated to poorly differentiated.
  - Remember there are no poorly-differentiated beningn tumors.
  - And rember that ther are malignant tumors that are well-differentiated, even completely differentiated and functional.
    - Examples are glandular or keratin forming malignant cells from previous example.
  - But malignant tumors can also be completely aplastic, where they have no specialized structure or product.
  - These anaplastic tumors may vary in size, but you will see NO functionality. No gland-forming, no keratin producing, they wont even look like surrounding cells.

So how can you determine if a mass is malignant if they can look differentiated?
- Pleomorphism: multiple different distinct forms
- Abnormal nuclear morphology
- The amount of mitotic figures
- Loss of polarity: Are the cells in the right place? Should they be deeper, near the basement membrane, but instead they are at the surface?
- extensive necrosis. And that's probably because due to insufficient blood supply, the tumor was growing much faster than any other development of blood supply to that growing entity

Do not confuse with metaplasia or dysplasia
Metaplasia is the replacemnt of one cell type with another. THis is almost always found in association with tissue damage and regen.
    - Esophagus getting keratineous after acid reflux
Metaplasia is not malignant. It does mean that there is some sort of chronic exposure to someting toxic though.

Dysplasia is disorder cell growth in epithelia. Cant really use the dysplasia definition on the mesenchymal architecture.
- loss in uniformity
- loss of architectural orientation
- pleomorphism
- hyperchromatic nuclei
- and more abundnat (but still normal) mitotosis
This is still not an invasive tumor. It isn't normal, but at this point its not malignant.
When the changes are pronounced it is called carcinoma in situ, which is a pre-invasive lesion. If not taken care of, it can become an invasive malignancy.
A pre-invasive lesion has marked dysplastic changes that involve the entire thickness of the epithelium, and it is still confined to normal tissue

Beningn tumors expand locally. THey form a acapsule around them of compressed connective tissue. These tumors don't directly invade or infiltrate.

Malignant tumors are poorly demarcated, they don't have a definable border. And they do infiltrate.

Pattern of metastases: 
Direct seeding of a surface or cavity
Lymphatic node spread (axiallary node example)
and Hematogenous spread (which means carried through blood.)

Risk Factors:
- Environmental factors dominate
- Age, Ethnicicty, Genetic Disposition
- Acquired predisposing factors:
  - Inflammation
  - Precursor lesions

Neoplasia 2
Chemical Carcinogens:
- Iniiation: irreversible, a result from cellular exposure. Not enough to cause tumors
- Muation: This occurs in initiated cells. The mutations are rapid and irreversible
- Promotion: This does not mutate DNA. It does lead to proliferation of initiated cells. Promotion is reversible. Depends on time and dose amount
