## Masic Concepts
Invasion is spread of cancer from origin into surrounding tissue
Metastasis is the process where tumors spread and establish new colonies at a distance away
Invasion and Metastasis are hallmarks of malignant tumors
Priciple cause of deat in cancer patients
Complex, multistep, and inefficient
**Three Routes**
- Lymphatics
- Blood vessels
- Serosal surfaces
Capacity to disseminate can be acquired early steps of tumorigenesis
Dormancy, hidden
**Most common sites of metastasis from solid tumors are**:
- **Legs**
- **Bones**
- **Liver**
- **Brain**
Leukemia, multiple myeloma and lymphoma celss are not usually localized, they can be all over the place. This is not metastasis
## Steps of Metastasis
1. Detach from primary mass
- Dissociation of cells from one another
  - **E-Cadherin**
- Degrade ECM
- Attachment of novel ECM components
- Migration of tumor cells
  - Malignant epithelial cells undergo EMT **Epithelial to mesenchymal transition** a process where epithelial cells switch to a phenoytype of mesenchymal cell
  - Protrusion of leading edge
  - Formation of focal contacts with ECM
  2. Invade local host tissue stroma by degrading ECM and MMPs
  3. Penetrate local lymphatic and blood vessels.
  4. Survive within circulation
  5. Arrest in cappilaries or venules
  - Random arrest occurs in all organs.
  - Programmed organ specific homing possible.
  - **Chemokine-receptor-mediated chemotaxis**
  - **Establish metastasis microenvironment**
  - **Adaptation of tumor to microenvironment**
  6. Penetrate corresponding parenchyma
  - Most cells either die in the blood or reach the lungs where they get destroyed or lie dormant
  - Some tumor cells get coated with platelets and leukocytes, creating microembolus that adheres to activated endothelial cells
  7. Survive new environment of other organ
  - Two classes of determinants that affect 
    1. Must be initiation of a viable premetastatic niche within target
       - Mobilization of hematopoietic progenitors from bone marrow to target site
       - Factors in micro-env may directly act on malignant tumor cell 
    2. Invading metastatic cell must display the appropriate functions to colonize new site
   8. Divide to form new tumors
## Models of Metastasis and Tumor Progression
Clonal evolution model **stochastic model**:
- Somatic mutations accumulate sequentially, resulting in rare cells that are capable of metastasis.
Tumor cells with **metastatic signature**:
- Genes associated with metastatic virulence and contribute to the survival and proliferation solely during colonization of metastatic site. No selective advantage
Combination:
- Combo of stochastic and signature models
Cancer Stem Cells:
Cancer cells can disseminate from a tumor early in the life of the tumor.
## New Concepts
**Capacity of cancer cells to disseminate is acquire at EARLY steps during tumorigenesis**
Cancer dormancy is a protracted stage in which tumors remain occult and asymptomatic
Ability of cancer to colonize distant organs likely determined by combined effect of many genes in the right environment.
Metastatic Spread can take place through multiple routes and directions
### Metastasis-Progression Genes
Necessary for certain function such as **vascular remodeling** that can operate in the primary tumor site as well as metastatic environment
### Clinical Implications
1. Molecular Signatures of Metastasis:
    - Predict clinical outcomes
    - Breast cancers with lung-metastatic signature have high risk of lung metastase, but not of bone or liver....
2. Targets of Therapy:
    - Each metastasis specific gene is a potential target for treatment
3. Clinical Translation:
    - Cancer Therapy might be determined by the metastatic site and not only by the specific tissue of origin
