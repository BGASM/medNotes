## Gene Mutation
Cancer is genetic disease
Arise from accumulation of gene mutations that promote uncrontrolled growth and invasive properties
- Genetic Damage: At least four mutations
  - Point mutation: Ras
  - Chromosomal Changes
  - Gene Amplification
  - Epigenetic changes  
- Inherited through Germline or caused by environmental factors
  - Environmental:
    - Chemicals: 
      - Alkylating Agents: Cyclophosphamide and Cisplatin (CHEMO DRUGS)
      - Naturally occuring carcinogens: Aflatoxin B1
      - **Chemical Carcinogenesis is dose-dependent!**
    - Radiation: Squamous cell carcinoma, Basal cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma, UVB, Ionizing, leukemias, thyroid carcinom
    - Viruses:
      - HPV
      - Bening squamous papilloma
      - Cervical carcinoma
      - HPV E6 inhibit p53
      - HPV E7 inhibits p53, p21, pRB
      - Epstein Barr
      - Burkitt
      - B cell lymphoma
      - Hodgkin Lymphoma
      - Hepatitis B
      - Hepatocellular carcinoma
      - How do HBV and HCV cause HCC? Well, they both cause injury to liver cells, which leads to extensive regeneration
    - Bacteria:
      - Helicobacter pylori
      - Gastric lymphoma
    - Inherited: Mutations in tumor suppressor and prot-oncogenes and DNA repair
Gene mutation can be divided into two categories:
- Pathological Importance (mutation)
  - 
- Polymorphism: SNP is DNA sequence variation where genome differes between members of a species
Epigenetic Changes are process that alter gene activity without changing DNA sequence. Leads to modifications that can be transmitted to daughter cells
- DNA Methylation
  - Hypomethylation seen in tumors
  - Consequence is **chromosomal instabillity, reactivation of transposable elements, and loss of imprinting**
- Hypermethylation in cancer cells:
  - Hypermethylation of promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes is a major event in the origin of cancer
  - DNA demthylating drugs in low dose have clinical activty against some tumors
## Model of Tumorigenesis
Clonal Expansion and heterogeneity of cancer
- Tumor is the clonal expansion of a single progenitor cell
- Malignant tumors are often heterogeneous
- Heterogeneity describes differences between tumors of the same type in different patients, and between cancer cells within a tumor.
- **Tumors are relatively monoclonal and heterogeneous**
**Clonal genetic model of cancer - Stochastic**
- *Every cancerous cell has the capacity to make a tumor*
- Low probability
- Problems with canonical cancer model
    - Cells derived from tumors are **frequently heterogeneous**
    - **Several mutations are needed** for a cell to become cancerous. Yet, these cells are **restricted by short life span of progenitor cells**
    - Established tumors in mouse model is inefficient, many cells needed to establish tumor.
**Cancer stem cell model:**
- *Very small subset of cells within tumor pop actually able to initiate and sustain tumor growth*
- May **originate from transformation of normal stem cell, progenitor, or differentiated cell**
- Cancer stem cell must possess two qualities to perform natural function
    - **Self-renewal**
    - **Differentiation**
- Cancer stem cell hypothesis predicts that **long-lived stem cells are more likely to accumulate initial mutations** leading to cancer
- **Transiently amplifying cells are immediate daughters of somatic stem cells**. Daughter cells **inherit parental mutations**, and **may be targets for final transforming** events that lead to tumors.
**Cancer Associated Genes:**
- Oncogenes
    - Considered dominant
    - Transform cells despite normal couterpart
    - Only need one mutant to develop
- Tumor suppressor
    - Two hit
    - Haploinsufficiency - Situation where total level of tumor suppressor produced by cell is about half the normal level and not sufficient for cell to function normally.
- Gene can be tumor suppressor gene or oncogene.
- MicroRNA might function as tumor suppressor  or oncogene
    - **let-7 inhibits RAS**
    - **23 promote breast cancer**
    - **PR-IncRNA-1 enhances p53 transciptional activation**
**Cell Cycle Control:**
- Two cell division events are:
  - S-phase when DNA replicates
  - M phase when mitosis occurs
- Transitions in and out of G1 G2 are regulated by cyuclins and CDKs
- Cancer has a defect in regulation of cell cycle
- Cyclins:
  - G1 Cyclin (Cyclin D)
  - S-phase Cyclin (Cyclins E and A)
  - Mitotic cyclin (cyclins B and A)
- CDK
  - G1 CDK4
  - S CDK2
  - M CDK1
**DNA Repair Genes**
Inherited mutations of DNA repair genes increase risk of devleoping cancer:
  - hPMS1
  - hPMS2
  - hMLH1
 **Apoptosis Regulatory Genes**
May be dominant or recessive
Pro-apoptotic factors: Bad, Bax, etc
Anti-apoptotic factors: BCL-2 **B cell lymphoma**
**Telomere associated Genes**
Length of telomeres range 8000bp at birth to 3000bp at aged
3' overhang gets extended during S phase
Heart muscles do not continually divide, so their telomeres don't shorten
Lose 30-200bp each cell division
Cells can normally divide 50-70 times
Cancer cells reactivate telomerase, the enzyme that rebuilds telomeres.
- Cells become immortal.
- **HTERT** is the catalytic subunit of telomerase that gets overexpressed in cancer cells
- TRF1 TRG2 POT1 and RAP1 are telomere-associated proteins that control telomere length.
## Cellular and Molecular Hallmarks of Cancer
1. Self-sufficiency in growth signals.
2. Insensitivity to inhibitory growth signals.
3. altered cellular metabolism.
4. Escaping Apoptosis.
5. Limitless replicative potential.
6. Sustained Angiogenesis.
7. Ability to Invade and Metastasize.
8. Ability to evade the host immune response
## NOTES:
No single oncogene can fully transform normal cells in vitro
Every cancer contains multiple genetic alterations
The paths through which each human cancer delvops are highly variable
