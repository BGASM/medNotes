## Hemorrhage:
- Defined as the **extravastation of intravascular blood to the extravascular space**.
- Petechiae
  - 1-2mm hemorrhage of skin, mucous membrane, or serosal surface
  - Locally increased intravasc pressure
  - Seen with low platelet count or defective platelet.
- Purpura
  - `>=3mm hemorrhage in same location and etiologie of petechiae
  - More common in vasculitic state
  - Feel the bumps...
- Ecchymose
  - Larger >= 1 cm subcutaneous collections of blood bruises.
  - RBC undergoing continous breakdown by macrophage.
- Hematoma
  - Term used for a collection of hemorrhage that has a well-defined and 3D shape.
  - You can use similar terms to describe as we used for edema.
- Rapid loss of 20% may be tolerated in healthy adults. 
  - Larger losses in a more rapid progression can result in hypovolemic shock.
- Recurrent hemorrhage that exits the body can lead to net iron loss and iron deficiency  anemia. 
  - The iron in the hemorrhage into a cavity or tissue is typically recovered and recycled.
 ## Thrombosis:
 - Thrombosis is pathologic
   - An unwanted thrombus.
 - Thrombus is physiologic and normal
   - Body makes one to initiate a coagulation cascade.
```
What is the point of this clarification?
Well, a hematoma is a 3d collection of blood within tissue.
A thrombosis is when an unwanted coagulation cascade has been initiated.
We clarify because once again, we need to determine if the red chunk we see within the tissue is due to a **bleeding or coagulation state**. Is it blood, or is it a thrombi?

The pathophysiology of hemostatic mechanisms can be determined by looking for sources of abnormalities. - *Virchow's Triad*.  
  - Endothelial Injury/Dysfunction
    - Injury here leads to exposure of ECM, released tissue factor,adherence of plateleys and begins the coagulation cascade.
      1. Myocardial infarction
      2. Atherosclerotic plaques
      3. Trauma
    - Dysfunction is any state where normal procoagulant and anticoagulant properties get messed up.
      1. Production of more procoagulant factor (plateley adhesion molecule, tissue factor, plasminogen activator inhibitor)
      2. LESS production of anti-coagulant factors (thrombomodulin, PGI2, tPA)
  - Hypercoagulability *thromophilia*
    - This can be the major etiology for any patient in a clinical setting, loosely defined as any alteration of the coagulation pathway that predisposes one to thrombosis. 
    - Causes can be genetic (*primary*) or acquired (*secondary*) in nature. 
    - **Primary:**
      - Factor V Leiden - Factor V 
      - Prothrombin gene mutation
      - Hyperhomocysteinemia
    - **Secondary:**
      - Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia syndrome
      - Antiphospholipid antibody syndrom
  - Abnormal blood flow
    - Disruption of laminar flow allows for coagulation components to start sticking.
      - This can be caused by hyperviscosity, sickle cell anemia, or aneurysms.
## Morphology of thrombus
Desribe a thrumbus.
- Arterial Thrombi
- Venous Thrombi
  - DVT
- Mural Thrombi
- Vegetations
- Post-mortem
## Fate of the thrombus
- If the initial insult is not fatal, one of four pathways can be discerned.
  1. Propagation – accentuation and prolongation of the hemostatic process
  2. Embolization – thrombi that disassociate from their main mass and travel to other sites  in the vascular tree.
  3. Dissolution – Small and/or recent thrombi can undergo fibrinolysis and completely  resolve. 
     - Larger and/or older thrombi are more resistant to lysis.
  4. Organization – the process of incorporating a thrombus into the “new normal.” 
     - Variable ingrowth of endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts to create remodeled vascular channels (**recanalization**), albeit imperfectly.
    
## Embolism
An embolism is a **detached intravascular solid, liquid, or gaseous mass** that gets carried by blood to some other site. A *thromboembolism* is an emolism that originates from a dislodged thrombus. Emboli can lodge in a vessels that are too small to permit passage, and this can cause vascular occlusion, which can lead to ischemic necrosis/infarction.
- **Pulmonary Embolus** **PE**
  - Venous in nature
  - **Commonly from DVT.**
  - Travel through large veins, through the right side of the heart and then get trapped in pulmonary arterial vasculatire.
    - Single embolus can straddle pulmonary artery bifurcation (saddle embolus)
    - Can lodge in a pulmonary artery main branch and cause one-sided disease
    - Most frequently, one or both sides of the lungs get small emboli that lodge in the smallest arterioles possible
    - **Patients who have had one PE are at high risk for having another**
  - `>60% ovvlusion can cause cardiovascular collapse.
  - Can lead to pulmonary hemorrhage, but not usually infarction
  - Small end-arterioles pulm. branches don't usually hemorrhage or infarct.
  - Multiple small emboli (over time) can cause pulmonary hypertension and right sided heart failure
- Systemic (thrombo-)embolus *Cause infarction typically*
    - Usually defined as an embolus in arterial circulation. 
    - 80% from **intracardiac mural thrombi**. Other causes include:
      - Valvular vegetation
      - Paradoxical embolus (venous embolism that makes it to arterial circulation because of other cardiac defect)
      - Aortic aneurysm
      - Thrombus on ulcerated atherosclerotic plaque. 
    - Emboli in arteries most likely lodge in the lower extremities (75%) and brain (10%), with theintestines, kidneys, spleen and upper extremities also affected.
- Fat and Marrow Embolism
  - After injury there can be a rupture of soft tissue venules or marrow vascular sinusoids.
  - Adipose tissue or bone marrow can herniate into the intravascular space and travel to lungs and get lodged.
    - Fracture of long bones: 90% of severe skeletal injuries lead to embolism, but only 10% have symptoms.
    - Soft tissue Trauma
    - Burns
    - **Vigorous cardiopulmonary resuscitation**:
  - **Fat Embolism Syndrome** is a situation where these types of embolism ARE symptomatic.
    - After 1-3 days patient experience pulmonary insufficiency, neuro symptoms, anemia, thrombocytopenia and a diffuse petechial rash.
    - This can be fatal in 5-15% of paitents.
  - Air embolism: 
    - More than 100cc of air is enough to have a clinical effect on pulmonary circulation.
    - Volumes smaller than that can be catastrophic if introduced into coronary circulation.
      - ie. during a coronary bypass surgery.
  - Decompression Sickness
    - Bends - gas bubbles in skeletal muscles
    - Chokes - respiratory distress caused by pulmonary gas emboli. Leads to edema, hemorrhage, and emphysema:
    - Caisson disease - chronic decompression condition. Persistence of gas emboli in skeletal system leads to multpile foci of ischemic necrosis
      - Mainly seen in femoral head, tibia, and humeri.
  - Amniotic Fluid Embolism:
    - Squamous cells, fat, or mucin make it to pulmonary vasculature
    - Severe respiratory compromise (dyspnea and cyanosis)
    - followed by Neuro impairment (headache, seizure, coma)
    - Finally disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
