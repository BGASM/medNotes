# Infarction
- Infarction is the process of ischemic necrosis due to either occlusion of arterial supply or of venous drainage.
- Mainly due to interruption of arterial supply, even if caused by a venous event.
  - Thrombotic events: *eg* DVT travels to lungs and then occludes **arterial** pulmonary artery.
  - Vasospasm
  - Extrinsic compression by tumor, edema, entrapment in hernia
  - Twisting/Torsion
  - Vessel rupture
  - Venous thrmobosis in organs with single venous outflow.
    ## Infarct Outcome
    - Dual blood supply (lung, liver, extremities)
    - Rate of occlusion: slower occlusion time allow for collateral circulation
    - Tissue's vulnerability to hypoxis
      - Neurons: 3-4 minutes
      - Myocardial: 20-30
      - Fibroblasts: hours
    ## Gross Morphology
    - Wedge shaped
    - Occluded vessel at apex, organ at base
    - Acute poorly defined and slightly hemorrhagic
    - Chronic defined with a *narrow rim of congestion* due to the inflammatory response
    - Red vs. White
    - Septic vs. Bland
        ### Red Infarct
        - RBC-rich blood present
        - Venous occlusion
        - Loose tissue (lung)
        - Dual blood supply
        - Congested
        - Previous occluison or necrosis.
        ### White Infarct
        - Organs with end-arterial supply (*heart, spleen, kidney*)
        - Anemic
        - Due to lack of nutrients into necrotic zone.
        ### Septic
        - Occur when infected heart valve vegetation embolize
        - Occur when microbes seed an area of necrosis
    ## Microscopic Morphology
    -   characterized by ischemic coagulative necrosis
        -   Timeline:
              - No visible histologic changes are the norm if ischemia occurs within minutes to a fewhours before death
              - 4-12 hours, tissue necrosis begins to appear, and acute inflammation begins to show up around the edges
              - 1-2 days, tissue necrosis is established, and the peripheral inflammatory response is well-defined
              - Reparative process follows over the next several days to weeks, where necrotic tissue is removed, and scar tissue replaces
# Shock
- Systemic hypoperfusion due to reduced cardiac output or blood volume
  ## Causes:
    - Severe hemorrhage
    - Extensive trauma
    - Large myocardial infarction
    - Massive PE
    - Septicemia
  ## Categories:
     1. Cardiogenic shock:
        - outflow obstruction (PE)
        - myocardial pump failure (myocardial infection, arrhythmia, or pericardial tamponade)
     2. Hypovolemic shock:
        - extensive hemorrhage and/or fluid loss (burns, trauma, vomiting, diarrhea)
     3. Septic shock: 
        - vasodilation and peripheral blood pooling caused by overwhelming microbial infection and associated immune response
     5. Neurogenic shock:
        - rarer cause with loss of vascular tone and peripheral pooling (anesthetic accident, spinal cord injury)
     7. Anaphylactic shock: 
        - rarer cause with systemic vasodilation and increased vascular permeability (IgE-mediated hypersensitivity)
   ## Stages:
     - Non-progressive:
       - Reflex neurohumoral compensatory mechanisms are activated (catecholamines, ADH, renin-angiotensin axis, etc.) 
       - Produces tachycardia, peripheral vasoconstriction, and renal conservation of fluid. 
       - Perfusion of vital organsmaintained.
     - Progressive:
       - Occurs when persistent hypoxemia leads to anaerobic glycolysis, lactic acid generation, and decreased tissue pH
       - This reduces vasomotor response
       - Leads to vasodilation, peripheral pooling, decreased CO, ultimately tissue hypoxia
     - Irreversible:
       - When re-perfusion will not correct death spiral
       - Ischemic bowel may lead to superimposed bactermia/septic shock
       - Renal failure and tubular necrosis can lead to anuria
    ## Morphology:
    ### Lungs:
    - Diffuse alveolar damage
      - Sepsis or trauma
    - Hyaline membranes lining alveolar spaces
    - Interstitial inflammation
    ### Kidneys:
    - Acute tubular necrosis causes oliguira, anuria, electrolyte disturbances
    - Swollen vacuolated tubular cells with necrosis and tubular casts
    ### Brain:
    - Red neurons and neuronal loss
    ### Adrenals:
    - Coritcal cell lipid depletion
    ### GI:
    - Ischemia with mucosal breakdown
    ### Skin:
    - Petechial hemorrhage
    ## Clinical Consequences:
    - Cardiogenic and hypovolemic:
      - Hypotension, weak rapid pulse, tachypnea, cool cyanotic skin.
    - Septic Shock:
      - Skin warm and flushed
    - Most healthy PT survive hypovolemic shock
    - Cardiogenic and spetic are less survivable
# Septic Shock
- Most common in infection by G+/- bacteria and fungi
- Several factors in causation:
  - Inflammatory and counter-inflammatory response
  - Endothelia cell activation/injury leading to increased thrombotic, vasodilation, permeability and edema
  - DIC
  - Metabolic abnormalities
    - Adrenal gland necrosis due to DIC is named Waterhouse-Friderichson Syndrome
  - Organ dysfunction when systemic hypotension, interstitial edema, small vessel thrombosis all decrease oxygen to organs.
    - Decreased cardiac contractility can lead to cardiovascular collapse
    - Increased vascular permeability and endothelial injury lead to lung failure
    - Anuria can develop due to acute tubular necrosis or renal failure
    - Multiorgan failure: liver, adrenals, etc.
 # Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation
 - Acute, Subacute, or chronic thrombohemorrhagic disorder.
 - Excessive activation of coagulation and thrombi formation.
 - Not a primary disease. A secondary response to disease.
    ## Triggers for DIC
    - Bacterial endotoxins can inhibit endothelial thrombomodulin production.
      - Endotoxins can also activate factor XII
    - Antigen-Ab complexes can activate classical complement pathway - which leads to complement fragments that activate platelets and granulocytes
    - Massive trauma causes tissue factor release
    - Placenta procoagulant proteins can enter circulation
    - Hypoxia, acidosis, shock
    - Leukemia and adenocarcinomas
  - **Activation of the coagulation cascade and excess thrombin will lead to microthrombi (fibrin thrombi) in tiny vessels throughout the body**
    - Fibrin thrombia create ischemia in organs and tissue.
    - Compensation for excess fibrin thrombi: ↑↑↑ coagulation inhibitors and fibrinolytic proteins
    - Simultaneous consumption of both **procoagulant** and **anticoagulant** proteins exhausts the body’s ability to create more
    - **End stage: bleeding**
   ## Consequences of DIC
   - Widespread deposition of fibrin
   - Ischemia
   - Microangipathic hemolytic anemia (*RBC fragment trying to squeeze through narrow vasculature*)
   - Hemorrhagic diathesis as clotting factors and platelets are consumed
