# Anti-Metabolite
**Anti-metabolites are specific for S phase**
- Types:
    1. Folate Antagonist - methotrexate
    2. Pyrimidine Antagonist - 5-FU
    3. Purine Antagonist - 6-mercaptopurine
## Pyrimidine ANtagonist: Cytarabine and Gemcitabine
Incorporate into cell and bind to DNA
### Toxicity
Toxic to normal cells that proliferate rapidly
   - GI
   - Bone marrow
- Dose dependent
    - IV bolus dose: incorporate into RNA - more myelosuppression
    - IV continuous dose: incorporate into DNA - more skin toxicity *hand and foot syndrome*
    - Prolonged administration damages DNA in epithelial cells of the skin.
  - Hand and Foot:
    - Gradual development of pain, redness, numbness and bilateral desquamation of palms
## Purine Antagonist
Fake purine bases.
   - 6-MP decoy for hypoxanthine
   - 6-TG decoy for Guanine
 - **Require intracellular activation. Parent compount can cause toxicity**
 - **Reduce HGPRT enzyme activity**
  - 6-TG is more potent
  - **6-TG causes more GI toxicity (more myelosuprressive)**
    - **Allopurinol** (drug for gout and tumor lysis syndrome) blocks xanthine oxidase and leads to **accumulation of 6-MP**
  - **Immunosuppressive**

# Tumor Antibiotics
**Specific for cells in G2 phase**
1. Anthracyclines: **Doxorubicin, epirubicin**, idarubicin, daunorubicin
2. Anthracenediones: Mitoxanthrone
3. Bleomycin
- **Doxorubicin and epirubicin most active** chemo drugs available
## Anthracyclines
### Anthracycline Mechanism:
**Intercalate between base pairs of DNA helix** 
- **Inhibit topoisomerase II** (*g2 phase*)
- **Supercoiled DNA**
- **Form free radicals**
### Antrhacycline Cardiotoxicity
**Cumulative cardiac toxicity**
  - **Formation of ROS**
  - **Damage to Topo II in cardiomyocytes**
- Damage with all doses, but symptoms appear with **cumulative exposure**
- Liposome-encapsulated antrhacycline delay cardiotoxicity
- **Chemoprotectant Dexrazoxane (DZR)** *prevents cardiac injury* but *inhibits antitumor activity* of anthracyclines
## Antrhacenediones
### Antrhacenedione Mechanism:
Similar to anthracyclines
- **DNA intercalataion and TOPO II inhibition**
- **Free radical formation** (*nitrogen dioxide*)
    - **NOT ROS**
  - **Cardiotoxic, but delayed**
## Bleomycin
### Bleomycin Mechanism:
- Bind to GC-rich portion of DNA and partially **intercalate**
- *Bind divalent metals such as* **iron, the active ligand**
- Oxygen binds to iron and produce **free radicals**
- Free radicals make **single-strand breaks**
### Bleomycin Toxicity
- **Cumulative toxicity**
- Detoxified by hydrolase
- Hydrolase low in **skin and lungs**

# Topoisomerase inhibitors
- **Specific for G2/S phase**
## Topoisomerase I - Campthothecins: Topotecan and Irinotecan
### Mechanism:
- Topo I relaxes supercoiled DNA
- Inhibitors prevent this. Strands break, lead to apoptosis/
- **S phase specific**
- **Irinotecan has unique GI adverse effect**:
    - **Early-onset acute diarrhea - Cholinergic syndrome**
    - Delayed-onset diarrhea - Unknown mech.
## Topoisomerase II -Podophyllotoxins: Etoposide and Teniposide
### Mechanism:
- **Pure Enzyme Inhibitors** meaning *NO free radical formation or DNA intercalation*
- Inhibit TOPO II.
  - **Halt progression out of S/G2 phase**
- *GI toxicities and myelosuppression*
  
# Microtubule Inhibitors
- **Specific for M phase**
## Taxanes: Paclitaxel, Docetaxel, nab-Paclitaxel
### Mechanism:
- **Mitotic spindle poisons**
- **Stabilize MT's against depolymerization**
- **Neurotoxic**
- *Myelosuppressive*

## Vinca Alkaloids: Vincristine, Vinorelbine, Vinblastine
### Mechanism:
- **Block mitotic cell division in M phase**
- Bind to tubulin and **inhibit polymerization MT's**
### Adverse Effects:
- MT's are primary structural element of mitotic spindle in nerve structures
- **Neurotoxicity**
    - **Dose and schedule dependent**
    - Autonomic and cranial nerve neuropathy
    - Encephalopath
    - **Vinorelbine is least neurotoxic but causes more myelosuppression**
- GI autonomic dysfunction (*bloating, constipation, abd pain*) complicates therapy with vinca alkaloids
### Drug Interactions:
- **Metabolic inhibitors** can lead to **overexposure** to vinca alkaloid
  - *P450*
# Targeted Therapies
Targeted Therapies attack specific molecular targets.
- Very effective if specific target is driving cancer-
- Less toxic that traditional-
- Generally not curative as single agents-
Traditional vs Targeted:
- Reduce mortality
- Stop disease progression
- More toxic
# Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors and Monoclonal Antibodies
## TKIs "nibs" - Imatinib, Dasatinib, Nilotinib
- Imatinib used for CML. Inhibit proliferation of bcr-abl fusion prot.
  - **Binds to ATP binding pocket of Tyr kinase**
- TKI's are part of normal cellular pathways
- Inhbition of TKI can cause **off-target** effects:
  - MoA has unintended organ insults
  - Myelosuppression
## Monoclonal Antibodies - Trastuzumab
- MAB that targets Her2/neu receptor.
  **- HER2/neu is also expressed in cardiomyocytes** - which explains **off-target cardiotoxicity**  
# Hormone Receptor Modulators
## Estrogen and Breast Cancer
Estrogen fuels growth of breast cancer cells
- Inhibitors:
  - Pre menopause: Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators **SERMs** - **Tamoxifen**
  - Post menopause: **Aromatase Inhibitors** - **Exemestane**
  - Average age of menoupause is 51 yrs.
### SERM - Tamoxifen
75% of breast cancer epxpress estrogen receptors *ER+*, 65% express progesterone receptors *PR+*
- Tamoxifen for hormonal therapy:
    - Prodrug. **Hydroxymetabolites** provide the anti-tumor activity.
    - Partial estrogen agonist
    - Antagonist in breast tissue
    - Can prevent breast cancer in high risk PT and treat those with advanced or localized disease
    - **Adverse**: Due to estrogenic effects - Uterine Cancer
### Aromatase Inhibitors
```Exemestane, Letrozole, Anastrozole â€“ Inhibit the enzyme aromatase ONLY in peripheral tissue (NOT in ovaries) so only useful in post-menopausal women```
# Epigenetic Modifiers
## Hypomethylating Agents Azacitidine and Decitabine
- **Inhibit DNA methyltransferases**
  - Hypomethylation
  - Apoptosis
  - Reverse epigenetic silencing
- Need to be incorporated into DNA through reduced metabolite
    - One cycle of replication gets hemimethylated. Two cycles for entire demthylation.
    - **Several doses** are needed for clinical response.
  - At high doses it acts like anti-pyrimidine (*cytotoxic and anti-metabolite*)
## Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors - Vorinostat, romidepsin, belinostat, panobinostat
- HDAC catalyzes **removal of acetyl groups** from histones.
  - DNA wraps more tightle when acetyl groups are removed. Silenced, euchromatin.
  - This prevents the expression of **tumor suppressor genes**
- HDAC inhibitors bind to the enzyme and prevent it.
- Increased acetylation of DNA, and **expression of the silenced genes**
- **Adverse Effects**:
  - Cardiac Toxicity
  - GI Tox
  - Mild myelosuppression

# Immunomodulatory Drugs
## Immuno Blockade Therapy
T cell activation requires two signals: TCR and B7/CD28 co-stim. 
In normal situations, T cell de-activate themselves by binding their CTLA4 receptor to CD80 on DC's.
PD1 pathway delivers inhibitory signals to immune system to slow down. Limits initiation and duration of immune response.
Tumor cells evade by either upregulating the PD1L or by upregulating CD80 and binding T cell CTLA4, downregulating them, or by
