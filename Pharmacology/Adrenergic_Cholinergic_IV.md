## **Effects of stimulating Alpha receptors:**
- A1:
  - Contract vascular smooth muscles
  - Increase foce of heart contraction
  - Dilate Pupils
  - Contract prostate
- A2:
  - Decrease NE release
  - Decrease NE release from CNS
  - Decrease Insulin Release
## **Effect of inhibiting Alpha receptors:**
- A1:
  - Vascular relexation
  - Decrease force of heart contraction
  - Pupil constriction
  - Prostate relax
- A2:
  - Increase NE

So, when we apply a non-selective Alpha antagonist we get a decrease in TPR (*due to the vascular relaxation and the decrease in heart contraction force*. ) This decreases blood pressure. Decrease in BP triggers a reflec tachycardia, which is an increase in cardiac output. NE gets released by the A2 inhibition. This NE that is release can then stimulate B1 receptors, which increase heart rate!

TI: 
 - Emergency hypertensive crisis
 - Preoperative of **pheochromocytoma** == **phentolamine**
**NOTE: Main use for non-selective alpha is to rapidly decrease blood pressure**
 1. Phenoxybenzamine (PBZ): Irreversible and Long Acting. Non-competitive.
 2. Phentolamine: Reversible, short acting.
  --------------------------------------------------
  Selective A1 antagonists: **LOWER BLOOD PRESSURE**
  1. Prazosin: **HYPERTENSION**
  2. Doxazosin & Terazosin: **HYPERTENSION and BPH**
  3. Tamsulosin: **BPH - Treat lower urinary tract symptoms caused by BPH**
    - Adverse: **POSTURAL HYPOTENSION AND SYNCOPE 1st dose falls**
    - **Do not cause reflex tachycardia.**
## Beta Blockers
**All Beta antagonists are competitive**
  - Well absorved after oral
  - Most do not cross BBB
  - No absolute selectivity

  ### Selective B1: *cardio-selevtive*
  New-AMEBBA:
     - **N**ebivolol - NO mediated vasodilation
     - **A**cebutolol - ISA (partial agonist) 
     - **M**etoprolol ←
     - **E**smolol - Very short duration, used for cardio emergency
     - **B**etaxolol
     - **B**isoprolol 
     - **A**tenolol ←
  ### Non-Selective: B1 and B2
     - Propranolol ← - Anxiety and Migraines
     - Timolol ← Open angle glaucoma (IOP)
     - Pindolol - ISA (partial agonist) some B2 activation
     - Carvedilol ← A1 receptor antagonist as well. Antioxidant. Blocks Ca2+ Used for heart failure
     - Labetalol - ISA (partial agonist) some B2 activation
     - Sotalol: Only beta blocker used for only one disease, which is a certain type of arrythmia. **Not even used for hypertenstion.**
  ### **Direct effect of Beta Blockers on the Heart: Decreased Heart Rate**
  - Production of Nitric Oxide (*potent vasodilator*): Nebivolol
  - ISA: Intrinsic Sympathomimetic  Activity: Partial B2 activation
      - Pindolol, Lavetalol (non-sel with ISA)
      - Decrease release of NE from nerve terminals (indirect effect)
  ```
  In some receptors, the B2 receptors that get stimulated by the beta-blocker's ISA happen to be really close to some A2 receptors. So when the B2 receptors get stimulated, they cause a little NE to get released and then that NE stimulates the nearby A2 receptors, which then has the overall, indirect, effect of decreasing further NE release.
  ```
  - Non-Selective B-blocker (without ISA *which means they do not have a partial agonist*)
   - Direct antagonism of B receptor, there is a decreased release of NE.
     - Carvedilol blocks Ca entry into the cell, which prevents contraction.
     - Antioxidant properties, which produces Nitric Oxide - which is a vasodilator.
   - Decrease Renin.

  ### **Adverse:**
   - Bradycardia
   - Depressed myocardial contractility and excitability
   - Hypoglycemia in diabetic patients
     - **Avoid using non-selective B-blocker because they inhibit insulin, glycogenolysis, and gluconeogenesis**
     - **Selective B1 blockers can be fine**
     - Keep in mind, the selective B1 do not cause tachycardia, instead it promotes bradycardia.
     - This is a a note because diabetic patients often notice tachycardia as a sign to get medical assistance.
   - Sudden withdrawl of 
  - Propanolol, Carvedilol, Metoprolol can all cross BBB and can have depressive effect on CNS.
  - Alter plasma lipids (↑TGL ↓HDL)
  - Hepatotoxicity caused by Labetalol
  - **If patient has asthma** avoid non-selective (ISA) Beta Blockers.**Carvedilol mainly** *because it is non-selective for B1 or B2 AND because it has ISA activity.*
    - **B2 antagonists cause bronchoconstriction.**
  ### **Selection:**
  - **PT with bronchospasm or diabetes**
      - Selective B1 antag: Metoprolol, Atenolol
  - **PT with bradycardia**
      - Use B-blocker with ISA: Pinolol, Acebutolol
  - **PT with hypertension or chronic heart failure**
      - Use B-blocker with A1 antag properties: Pindolol, Carvedilol, Acebutolol



## Indirect:
### Reserpine: cause depletion of catecholamine stores
 - Inhibits VMAT. Prevents NE vesicular storage.
 - As NE gets used up it does not get replaced.
 - No catecholamines build up
 - Rarely used to treat refractory hypertension
 - Causes headaches
  
### A-methyldopa: false neurotransmitter
- Gets metabolized as a false-precusor of NE.
  - MethyINE
  - Takes up space and not recognized as an NT.
- Used for hypertension mainly in pregnancy.
- A2 agonist and false neurotransmitter.
  
### A-methyltyrosine: catecholamine inhibitor
 - Inhibits TH tyrosine hydroxylase
 - Used in treatment of inoperable pheochromocytoma
