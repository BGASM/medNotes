## Chemotherapy I
- Oncogene vs Tumor Suppressor | Gain of Function vs Loss of Function
- Treating oncogenes the goal is to suppress
    - e.g. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor
- Treating suppressor genes goal is to activate
    - e.g. MAB cetuximab, which activates p53.
#### Hallmarks of Cancer
- Sustained proliferation
- Evade growth suppressors
- Enable replicative immortality
- Resist celld eath
- Activate invastion and metastasis
- Induce angiogenesis
- Genome instability and mutation
- Avoid immune destruction
- Deregulate cellular metabolism
- Tumor promoting inflammation
- ![Targetting Cancer](file:///P:/Rashwonda/Documents/Publii/sites/bhole/input/media/posts/temp/target.JPG =716x528)
### Challenges
#### Multiple mutations
#### Heterogeneity
  - 2/3 of mutation from single biopsy not detected in different regions of the same tumor
#### Epigenetics
  - Normal cells acquire gentic and epigenetic alterations
  - Trying to treat cancer can exert additional pressure that accerlates its development of resistant
  - Epigenetic therapy can reverse these and restore sensitivity to treatment
  - Epigenetic targets enzymes - less toxic than chemo.
 - **Great if use in combination therapy**
#### Tumor Microenvironment
- Multiple cell types that support tumor growth
    - **Immune cells**
    - **Fibroblasts**
    - **Endothelial cells**
    - **Vasculature**
    - *Pancreatic cancer is not majorally cancerous cells, large portion is **fibroblast***
- These microenvironment cells are all **targetable**
#### Drug Resistance:
  - **P-glycoprotein efflux pumps** extrude chemotherapy drugs
  - Drug metabolism
  - Drug sequestration
  - Alter signal transduction pathways
  - Evade or ignore programmed cell death
### Chemotherapy:
  - Dev 1940-1960 for solid tumors, hematological malignancies
  - Integrated with surgery and radiation
  - Obstacles: 
    - R
    - Hurt normal cells   
#### History:
    - Mechlorethamine
    - Anti-metabolites
      - Methotrexate and 5-fu
    - Vinca Alkaloid
    - Cisplatin to inhibit cell division and cure solid tumors
    - Cure of Hodgkin's disease and ALL
    - Adjuvant chemotherapy
    - Cure of testicular cancer (vinblastine + bleomycin + cisplatin)
    - Targeted Therapy:
      - Gleevec - RTK for CML
      - Rituximab - NHL
## Types of Chemo
- **Primary Induction**
    - **advanced and no alternative**
    - Palliative
    - **Improve quality of life**
    - Prolong time to tumor progression (TTP)
- **Neoaduvnat**
      - localized cancer
      - Not completely effective
      - Used when surgery is not possible
- **Adjuvant**
      - follow surgery and radiation
      - Reduce incidence of local and systemic recurrence
      - **Improve overall survival** **OS**
      - **Prolong disease free survival** **DFS**
### Targetting the Cell Cycle
-  ![Cell Cycle](file:///P:/Rashwonda/Documents/Publii/sites/bhole/input/media/posts/temp/CELLCYCLE.png =1498x779)
-  Cell survival exponentially related to dose
- Slope of curve related to rate of cell proliferation
- **Effective** against those cells that **proliferate rapidly**
- Cause of Side Effects
    - **Bone marrow** stem cells: Immunocompromise
    - GI mucosal cells: 
    - Hair Follicles: Alopecia
    - Ovaries testes
### Therapeutic Window
    - Goals are to maximize efficacy and limit tocicity
    - Usually use maximum tolerated dose
### Drug Resistance: Goldie-Coldman Model
  - Drug resistance probability is dependednt on intrinsic genetic instabillity
  - Even the *smallest detectable tumor contains at least 1 drug-resistant clone*.
    - **Use all effective chemo drugs**
### Combination Chemotherapy
- ![Combo](file:///P:/Rashwonda/Documents/Publii/sites/bhole/input/media/posts/temp/combo.JPG =1578x906)
### Route of Administration - 5-FU
- IV bolus dose vs IV continuous infusion
    - IV Bolous: Incorporate into cellular RNA and myelosuppression
    - IV Continuous: Incorporate into cellular DNA but skin toxicity
- Intermittent dose
    - 600mg/m2/cycle
    - No cardiac or bladder toxicity
    - Secondary malignancies can develop
- Single high dose
  - Cardiac toxicity
  - Hemorrhagic cystitis
- Daily Dose
    - Hemorrhagic cystitis
    - Secondary Malignancies
### Pharmacokinetics
- Phramocokinetics represents the kinetics of accumulation and disapperance from plasma

## Alkylating Agents
- Classes:
  1. **Nitrogen mustards**
  2. **Nitrosoureas**
  3. **Triazenes**
  4. **Platinum complexes**
### Alkylating Mustards: 
#### General Mechanism:
 - Drug activated into *reative intermediates* that **form adducts** at N7 position of guanine in DNA
 - Loss of the guanine base (*depurination*) or miscoding of abnormal base pairing
 - Strand break or cross-linking of DNA
 - Cell death
  - ![Alkylate](file:///P:/Rashwonda/Documents/Publii/sites/bhole/input/media/posts/temp/alkylate.JPG =876x659)
 ```
 Alkylating groups on nitrogen mustard act as "warhead"
 N7 on guanine acts as electron donor, forming adduct
 React with 2nd guanine, leading to depurination
 ```
#### Reactivity:
- Reactivity can be reduced by adding aromatic ring to warhead.
- Less reactivity allows for drug to be given orally.
  - Elderly patients with multiple myeloma or CLL
#### Notes on Mustards  
##### Alkylating Mustards: **Cyclophosphamide and Ifosfamide** are **pro-drugs**
  - Share same active cytotoxic ingredient: phophoramide mustard
  - Both metabolized to **acrolein** (toxic to bladder - **hemorrhagic cystitis**)
##### Alkylating Mustards: **Cyclophosphamide and Ifosfamide** and acrolein toxicity
  - Hemorrhagic cystitis is dose and schedule dependent
  - Acreolin react with nucleophiles in uroepithelium:
    - Prevent with adequate hydration or MESNA
    - MESNA inactivates acrolein by binding to and preventing reaction with cellular nucleophiles
    - MESNA can prevent hemorrhagic cystitis, but not treat it.
    - Treatment is hydration with saline
    - **Blood in urine of PT treated with cyclophosphamide** is an early warning sign of bladder tox.
##### Alkylating Mustards: Ifosfamide Neurotoxicity:
  - Ifosfamide shares hemorrhagic cystits toxicity with cyclophosphamide - **acrolein**
  - Also has Unique CNS neurotoxicity: 
    - Chloroacetaldehyde distrub mitochondrial respiratory chain
    - **Methylene blue is the antidote**. Inhibits formation of **chloroacetaldehyde**
    - ![Ifosamide](file:///P:/Rashwonda/Documents/Publii/sites/bhole/input/media/posts/temp/ifosamide.JPG =871x657)
#### Alkylating Nitrosoureas
- Liberate organic isocyanates
- React with lysine residues
- Inactivation of protein, esp DNA repair enzyme
- **Highly lipophillic** and used to treat brain tumor because **cross BBB**
#### Alkylating Triazenes
- **Methylate** DNA at O6 and N7 positions on **Guanine**
- Temozolamide is **highly lipophillic**

#### Alkylating Platinum Complexes
  - React with DNA to produce inter and intra strand crosslinnks between adjacent guanines, or guanine and adeninge
  - Produce **DNA adducts** that inhibit replication and transcription
  - **Cisplatin, Carboplatin**: 
    - Good for **neck cancer**. 
    - Cistplatin has **High nephrotoxicity**
    - Carboplatin has **low nephrotoxicity**
  - Oxaliplatin: 
    - More effective for **colon and pancreatic**
    **- Nephrotoxicity**
  - Oxaliplatin more potent than cisplatin in vitro and requires fewer DNA adducts to achieve cytotoxicity
  - Carboplatin is a larger molecule than cisplatin; longer retention and different toxicities (less)
  - **Cytotoxic activity against different tumors and toxicity NOT the same with different platinum compounds**
#### Alkylating Miscellaneous: Procarbazine
  - MAOI: MAO - Inhibitor

    - Methylkate DNA
    gernate isocyanates
- Same adverse effects:
    - Hemorrhagic cystitis
    - CNS toxicity
    - Nephrotoxicity and neuropathy
  - Lipophillic agents have unique applications
### Summary of Alkylating Agent Toxicity:
- More toxic to normal, rapidly proliferating cells
- Non-cell cycle specific
- Damage DNA
    - Increase mutations
    - Secondary malignancies are long-term
        - Leukemias
        - Myelodysplastic syndrome
