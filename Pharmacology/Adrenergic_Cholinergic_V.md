## Intro
### 
- Aceytlchole binds on both Nicotinic and Muscarinic receptors
- On nictotinic it has an ionotropric effect, allowing passage of ions.
- On muscarinic it binds to M receptors and has a metabotropic effect, which are all GPCRs
- In PNS it is the parasympathetic system that uses Ach for post-ganglion signalling on muscarinic receptors
- CNS
  - Nictonic Effects: Reward, arousal, improve task performance
  - Muscarinic: Learning and memory
Drugs acting on chilinergic systems in the PNS or CNS can act as either cholinomimetics, or cholinolytics.

## Cholinomimetics
- Stimulate the cholinergic systems by enhancing the effects of either nicotinic or muscarinic receptors.
- THey may also be indirectly stimulated by blocking AchE.
- Directy agonists such as nicotine, Ach, carbachol, succinychole, or varenicline
- Directly agonist such as pilocarpine and muscarine, ACh, Carbachol, Bethanechol, Methacholine, Cevimeline
### DIRECT Cholinomimetic: Agonists on muscarinic and nicotinic receptors
#### Muscarinic Agonist
- Esters:
  - Poorly absorveb and little CNS access because they are hydrophilic
  - They are hydrolyzed in the GI in the following priority:
    - ACH >>> METHacholine >>> Bethanechol >>> Carbachol 
  - ACh use is limited to some opthalmic procedures to cause miosis.
  - Carbachol has the longest duration
      - Better choice drug for causing miosis
      - Constricts pupil and lowers IOP
      - Topical and intraoculare injections
      - AE: May cause asthma if it reaches PNS
  - Bethanechol
    - Selectivelty stimulates urinary and GI tract
    - Does not cause bradycardia
    - **Stimulate urinary retention**
  - Methacholine
    - Used for diagnostic only
    - Not used clinically
    - Asthma challenge test - bronchoprovocation test

- **Cardiovascular system**: **M2** Inhibitory effect on heart predominates. Little effect on vasculature. 
  - Moderate doses – increase vascular resistance and BP.

10. Explain the main differences between succinylcholine and ‘curoniums’.
- Muscarine mimicked parasympathetic nerve dischage. Its effects were **parasympathomimetic**
- . The effects of acetylcholine itself and of other cholinomimetic drugs at autonomic neuroeffector junctions are called parasympathomimetic effects and are mediated by muscarinic receptors.
- nicotine stimulated autonomic ganglia and skeletal muscle neuromuscular junctions but not autonomic effector cells. The **ganglion and skeletal muscle receptors were therefore labeled nicotinic**.
- acetylcholine was later identified as the physiologic transmitter at both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors, both receptors were recognized as **cholinoceptor subtypes.**
- Direct-acting cholinomimetic agents bind to and activate muscarinic or nicotinic receptors
- Indirect-acting agents produce their primary effects by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase.
  - By inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, the indirect-acting drugs increase the endogenous acetylcholine concentration in synaptic clefts and neuroeffector junctions.
- First, *acetylcholine released from parasympathetic nerves* **activates** muscarinic receptors on **effector cells** to alter organ function directly. 
- Second, *acetylcholine released from parasympathetic nerves* interacts with muscarinic receptors on **nerve terminals** to **inhibit the release of their neurotransmitter**. 
- Muscarinic agonist binding to **M1, M3, and M5** receptors activates the **inositol trisphosphate (IP3), diacylglycerol (DAG)** cascade.
- Activation of **M2 and M4** muscarinic receptors **inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity** in tissues (eg, heart, intestine)
- Continued presence of the nicotinic agonist **prevents electrical recovery** of the postjunctional membrane. Thus, a state of **“depolarizing blockade”** occurs initially during persistent agonist occupancy of the receptor. Continued agonist occupancy is associated with return of membrane voltage to the resting level. The receptor becomes **desensitized** to agonist, and this state is refractory to reversal by other agonists.
- **Effects of direct-acting cholinoceptor stimulant**
  - Sinoatrial node: **Decrease in rate (negative chronotropy)**
  - Atria: **Decrease in contractile strength (negative inotropy)**. Decrease in refractory period
  - Atrioventricular node: **Decrease in conduction velocity (negative dromotropy)**. Increase in refractory period
  - Ventricles: Small decrease in contractile strength
