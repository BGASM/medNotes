## Direct Adrenergic Stimulants (agonists)
----------
- Factors that influence response to cholinergic and adrenergic drugs:
    - Physical chemical properties
    - Route of administration and the pharmacokinetic properies
    - Localization density and proportion of receptor
    - Affinity for receptor subtypes
    - Compensatory reflexes
    - Receptor desensitization
    - Disease State
    - Age

## Organization:
----------
- Drugs acting on adrenergic systems:
- Peripheral (Sympathetic) and Central
- Adrenergic stimulants: Mimetics
    - Direct
    - Indirect
    - Both
- Adrenergic Blockers: Lytics
    - Direct
    - Indirect
## Adrenergic Stimulants (Sympathomimetics)
----------
- Direct - Direct drugs mimic catecholamines as selective or non-selective. This is referring to therapeutic doses. In high concentration above the TD, drugs may lose selectivity.
    - Adrenergic Receptor Agonists:
        - Alpha 1 and 2
        - Beta 1, 2, 3
        - All coupled to G protein
            - Metabotropic
            - Use of second messengers
            
    - ### Adrenergic System Recap:
        ----------
        - Sympathetic come from thoraco-lumbar region
        - Organized mainly in paravertebral ganglion
        - Pre-gang neuron uses ACh to communicate with post-gang neuron
        - Post-gang releases 80% NE, and only 20% Epi.
        - Fight or Flight
            - Tachycardia, bronchodilation, vasoconstriction in most vessels
            - Vasodilation in SOME vessels, such as those supplying skeletal muscles
        - Dopamine is released to control renal vascular tone, but not a primary catecholamine.
        - Adrenal gland acts as like a post-ganglion neuron.
            - It releases 80% epinephrine, 20% NE <<< Different than normal neurons.
        - CNS is mostly affected by NE.
            - Attention, alertness, concentration, energy, reduce appetite, sex drive.
     
    - ### Therapeutic Indication of NE:
      ----------
      - Treat cardiogenic shock (IV)
        - Increase total peripheral resistance.
        - Increase diastolic and systolic blood pressure during cardiogenic shock.
        - Poor oral bioavailability. Quikcly inactivated by COMT and MAO in the liver and gut.
        - Short action duration because it is matbolized.
        - Lack of selectivity.
    - ### Therapeutic Indications of Epi:
      ----------
      - Rapid relief of anaphylaxis reactions
      - Prolong the effect of local anesthetics (alpha 1)
    - **Ceases bleeding (hemostatic agent) (alpha1â†’ vasoconstriction)**
    - Beneficial for asthma
        - B2: decrease in antigen-induced inflammatory mediator release
        - a1: decrease in bronchial secretion and congestion in mucosa
        - **B2: Increases bronchodilation**
    - Adverse Effects:

    - ### Selectivity
    ----------   
    - Relative affinity: Epinephrine typically has a higher affinity for adrenergic receptors
        - A1: Epi > NE
        - A2: Epi > NE
        - B1: NE= Epi
        - B2: Epi >>NE
        - B3: NE > Epi
