## LO's
1. Explain the stages and approximate timeline of neurulation in the embryo.
    * Week 3: Germ layers, ectoderma thickens to form surface ectoderm and neuroectoderm
      * Neuroectoderm forms neural plate.
      * Edges of plate elevate and form neural tube.
    * Week 4: Anterior and posterior neuropore close (day 25 and 27)
      * Anterior form three primary brain ventricles
      * Posterior form the lumbrosacral region
2. Describe the cell types/structures that the neural crest and neural tube cells develop into.
   * Neural crest: PNS, Schwann, melanocyte, adrenal medulla, DRG, sat cells, etc. 
   * Neural tube: CNS
3. Name the primary and secondary embryonic vesicles and their adult derivatives.
    #### 4th week of development
    * Prosencephalon (forebrain):
    * Mesencephalon (midbrain):
    * Rhombencephalon (hindbrain):
    #### 5th week of development
    * **Prosencephalon**
      * Telencephalon -> Cerebral hemispheres | Lateral Ventricles
      * Diencephalon -> Thalami | Third ventricle
    * **Mesencephalon**
      * Mesencephalon -> Midbrain | Aqueduct (of Sylvus)
    * **Rhombencephalon**
      * Metencephalon -> Cerebellum and Pons | Upper part of fourth ventricle
      * Myelencephalon -> Medulla | Lower part of fourth ventricle
4. Explain the three histologically distinct zones of the neural tube (ventricular, intermediate,
   marginal)and what theygive rise to.
   * After neural tube forms there are three different histological layers
   * Ventricular zone: all neurons of CNS and glial cells
   * Intermediate zone: Gray matter of CNS
   * Marginal zone: myelinated axons, or white matter of CNS
   
5. Describe the formation of the alar and basal plates and how the ventral/dorsal relationship of 
   these plates determines the layout of sensory and motor neurons.
   * Sulcus limitans: divides neural tube into dorsal and ventral regions: alar (dorsal) and basal 
   (ventral)
   * Alar plate: sensory and interneurons - dorsal horn
   * Basal plate: motor and interneurons - ventral horn
   * Lateral horns T1-L2/L3 and contain preganglionic sympathetic motor neurons
6. Explain and be able to identify the malformations associated with incomplete neural tube closure
   and incomplete fusion of neural arches.
   * Ancephaly: Defective closure of anterior neuropore. Usually fatal: forebrain does not form and
   calvarium is open. *Day 25*
   * Spina bifida: Failure of posterior neuropore closure. Incomplete vertebral arch fusion. 
     * Occulta: Symptom-free and clinically insignificant.
     * Cystica: Herniation of neural structures through vertebral arches.
       * Meningocele: meninges and CSF *men-in-go-seal*
       * Meningomyelocele: Meninges, CSF, spinal cord, cauda equina - paralysis *men-in-go-my-lo-seal*
       * Myeloschisis: Spinal cord remains open because skin did not fuse. Permanent paralysis 
       *my-lo-see-chiss*
     * Folic acid supplements to prevent
7. Describe important developmental events and have a general idea of when these events occur.
### Types of Developmental Events and Timeline After Formation of Secondary Embryonic Vesicles
A. Neuronal Proliferation:
  * Peaks at 3rd 4th month
  * Occur in subventricular zone of forebrain
B. Neuronal Migration and Survival:
  * Peaks at 3rd and 5th month
  * Migrate using astrocyte scaffolds, guided by SHH
  * Only 1/2 survive. Without neurotrophic signals they apoptose. Children are producing 2x the 
  amount of neruons that is needed. Synaptic pruning.
C. Synaptogenesis and Synaptic Pruning:
  * Begin at 8th week
  * Synapse persistance depends on astrocytes and trophic factors
  * Pruning reduces the number of synapses, only the most efficient survive
D. Myelination:
  *  6th month, peaks during 1st year after birth and continues into adulthood
  *  Myelin sheaths in CNS formed by oligodendrocytes

8. Understand the role of chemical factors such as sonic hedgehog(SHH)and BMP in determining
   developmental processes.
   * SHH is ventral/Basal/floor
   * BMP is dorsal/alar/roof
----------------------

### Neural Tube Formation and Neural Crest Cells
* Neuralation
* Cranial and Caudal, Dorsal and Ventral
* Ectoderm is subdivided: Surface ectoderm, Neuroectoderm.
  * Surface ectoderm makes skin, epidermis, epithelial linings etc.
  * Neuroectoderm thickens and gives rise to neural systems except for microglia (which 
    differentiate from mesoderm)
* Neuroectoderm thickens and forms neural plate.
* Neural plate gets signals from notochord (Nucleus pulposis of IVD) 
* Neural plate folds and neural crest cells flank the neural groove. They eventually meet and fuse,
  forming a neural tube. The tube is open at the rostral (anterior neuropore) and caudal (posterior
  neuropore) ends.
* Anterior neuropore closes by day 25 and posterior closes by day 27.
* Anterior neuropore contains three brain vesicles.
* Posterior closes to form lumbrosacral region.
* When the neural tube closes there are neural crest cells directly deep to the surface ectoderm 
  cells. The neuroectoderm forms the neural tube, and the neural crest cells will form the
  peripheral nervous system: melanocytes, Schwann cells, adrenal medulla cells, dorsal root, sensory
  ganglia, meningial cells, etc.

### Histodifferentiation
* After neural tube forms there are three different histological layers
* Ventricular zone: all neurons of CNS and glial cells
* Intermediate zone: Gray matter of CNS
* Marginal zone: myelinated axons, or white matter of CNS
* Sulcus limitans: divides neural tube into dorsal and ventral regions: alar (dorsal) and basal 
  (ventral)
* Alar plate: sensory and interneurons - dorsal horn
* Basal plate: motor and interneurons - ventral horn
* Lateral horns T1-L2/L3 and contain preganglionic sympathetic motor neurons

### Neural Patterning
* Roof Plate: Dorsal midline of neural tube.  Adjacent to the surface ectoderm, which secretes BMPs.
  BMP's instruct the dorsal portion of neural tube to create the roof plate. Roof plate secretes BMP
  to influence development of sensory neurons.
* Floor Plate:  Ventral midline of nerual tube. Notochord, secrete SHH which instructs ventral 
  portion of neural tube to create floor plate, which will then secrete SHH and influence development
  of motor neurons.
* SHH -> Motor Neurons

### Congenital Malformations of Nervous System
* Ancephaly: Defective closure of anterior neuropore. Usually fatal: forebrain does not form and
  calvarium is open. *Day 25*
* Spina bifida: Failure of posterior neuropore closure. Incomplete vertebral arch fusion. 
  * Occulta: Symptom-free and clinically insignificant.
  * Cystica: Herniation of neural structures through vertebral arches.
    * Meningocele: meninges and CSF *men-in-go-seal*
    * Meningomyelocele: Meninges, CSF, spinal cord, cauda equina - paralysis *men-in-go-my-lo-seal*
    * Myeloschisis: Spinal cord remains open because skin did not fuse. Permanent paralysis 
    *my-lo-see-chiss*
  * Folic acid supplements to prevent
