      * Home to life-sustaining functions such as breathing, cardiac function, and consciousness.
      * In the spine we had grey matter on the inside, white on the outside. Within brain this gets 
        intermingled.
    * [Brain:](#brain)
      * Two cerebral hemispheres. Physically identical, but functionally not.
      * Contralateral control.
      * Each is covered with a multi-layered quilts of neurons called a cortex
5. List planes of sections and directional terms used for CNS. Describe structures in relation to
   one another using correct terminology. Be able to identify coronal, sagittal, and horizontal sections.
----------
### Neurons:
Dendrites receive. Soma keeps neuron alive. Axons communicate. And a synapse is the connection spot
between axon and dendrite.

### Divisions:
* CNS: Brain, brainstem, spinal cord
* PNS: Spinal nerves, cranial nerves
* Both contain gray and white matter. Gray = neuronal cell bodies, white = myelinated axons.
* In CNS a collection of neuronal cell bodies is called a nucleus.
* In PNS a collection of neuronal cell bodies is called a ganglion.
* In CNS a bundle of axons can be called: tract, lemniscus, column, fasciculus, funiculus, etc.
* In PNS it can be called a nerve, ramus, cord, etc.
  
### Modality:
* Sensory systems - input to CNS in multiple modalities. Modality is a type of information like touch
, pain, visual, etc.
* Cognitive systems - process incoming sensory information in the context of memories, emotions,
expectations, plans.
* Behavioral systems - govern state of the brain ie. sleep, awareness, emotional state, motivation

### Output:
* Somatic motor
* Autonomic (visceral motor)
* Neuroendocrine (homeostatic)
  
### Spinal Cord:
* Extends from lowest part of brainstem
* Allow brain and brainstem to control body/limbs
* Contain white matter bundles that run up and down, as well as a core of cell bodies
* Dorsal Root Ganglion: Dorsal Root is a white matter structure that links sensory to CNS
* Ventral Root: White matter. Motor
* Dorsal Horn: Grey matter

### Brainstem:
* Midbrain
* Pons
* Medulla - physically connects to spinal cord
* Brainstem is a conduit for fibers from brain to spinal cord
* Home to gray matter that carries out motor commands to and sensation from, the head and neck.
* Home to life-sustaining functions such as breathing, cardiac function, and consciousness.
* In the spine we had grey matter on the inside, white on the outside. Within brain this gets 
  intermingled.

### Brain:
* Two cerebral hemispheres. Physically identical, but functionally not.
* Contralateral control.
* Each is covered with a multi-layered quilts of neurons called a cortex

### Lobes of Cerebral Cortex:
* Frontal: Primary motor cortex/executive functions (decision-making, logic)
* Parietal: Somatosensory cortex
* Temporal: Auditory cortex
* Occipital: Visual cortex

### Hemispheric Contents:
* Cortex has ridges (gyri) and valleys (sulci)
* Cortex connected to itself and other structures by network of white matter bundles inside each 
  hemisphere.
* More gray matter nuclei (sub-cortical grey matter) within the cortex
* Corpus callosum is a sub-cortical white matter bridge between left and right hemispheres.

### Examples of sub-cortical gray matter:
* Thalamus: gateway to cortex, one on each side
* Hypothalamus: maintains homeostasis, controls autonomic, and endocrine function
* Basal Ganglia: Caudate, putamen, globus pallidus
* Cerebellum: 'little brain'

### Grey and White matter in CNS:
* Within the hemispheres the (cortical) grey matter is on the outside, 
  and the white matter is deep.
* Subcortical structures are dotted within this deep white matter.
* Within the brain stem the grey and white matter is more mixed up and intermingled.
* Within the spinal cord the grey matter is deep, making the horned butterfly shape, surrounded by 
  white.
* There is a fluid filled *ventricular system* within the hemispheres. They produce and circulate
  CSF. Always next to caudate nucleus.

### Planes of Section
* Horizontal, Coronal, Sagittal
* Remember, for spine rostral = top of head and for brain rostral = beak/face
