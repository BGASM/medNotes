Staphylococcus
Gram+ cocci: Extracellular, Opportunistic, catalase-positive, coagulase negative or positive, beta-hemolytic
    
    Coagulase Negative:
    Opportunistic, catalase-positive, beta-hemolytic slime layer, sub-acute

    Coagulase Positive:
    S. aureus - MRSA
    Cause:  Toxin-mediated diseases like enterotoxic food poisoning.
            Toxic Shock Syndrome
            Endocarditits
            Pyogenic diseases

    Normal flora, chill on the skin.
    Once inside they have numerous virulence factors that allow it to colonize and wreck havock:
        Capsule
        Slime layer
        Peptidoglycan                - inhbit phagocytosis
        Teichoic acid                - bind fibronectin
        Protein A                    - bind IgG's
        Cytotoxins                   - lyse RBCs and PMNs
        Exfoliative Toxins           - Serine proteases
        Enterotoxins                 - cause food poisoning. Heat labile
                                     - Superantigen that cause T Cell mediated disease, like scalded skin syndrome SSS
        Toxic Shock Syndrome Toxin   - Superantigen that causes TSSS

    Diseases:       - Endocarditits
                    - Pneumonia
                    - Toxic Shock
                    - Scalded Skin Syndrome
                    - Food poisoning
    
    Labs:           - Mannitol-salt agar to select from other bacteria
                    - Blood agar to select from G+ alpha-hemolytic
                    - Catalase to discern from Strep
                    - Coagulase to discern S. aureus from coagulase-negative Staphylococcus

    Treatment:      - MSSA:     - Naficillin/Oxacillin
                    - MRSA: 
                            - Localized infections: 
                                - trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole
                                - doxycycline
                                - clindamycin
                                - linezolid
                            - Systemic infections: 
                                - vancomycin
                                - daptomycin
                                - tigecycline
                                - linezolid
